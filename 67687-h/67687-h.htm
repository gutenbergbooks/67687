</div>


<p>The History of Literature, as a separate branch of the history of civilization,
is of comparatively recent origin; the first work on the subject in any
language dating no further back than the sixteenth century, and being little
more than a crude catalogue of authors and their books. Yet who can deny
the great importance of such history? When studied in connection with
illustrative extracts from the masterpieces of which it treats, it furnishes a
key to the intellectual development of our race, introduces us to the great
minds that stand as beacon lights in successive ages, and with their wisdom
widens the scope of knowledge, while it refines the taste and disciplines the
judgment. Lord Bacon said but the truth, when he remarked that the history
of the world without the history of letters would be as incomplete as a
statue of Polyphemus deprived of his single eye.</p>

<p>Nor is this study without results of a direct practical bearing. Certainly
all must appreciate the importance of understanding current allusions to
the writers and literary works of other ages and countries, and must admit
that some acquaintance at least with such writers and works is essential to
a well-grounded knowledge of one’s own language and a correct estimate
of its literature. But when is such an acquaintance to be obtained, if not
during a school or college course? The engrossing duties of after-life leave
little time for the pursuit of liberal studies. And how is such an acquaintance
to be obtained? All are not linguists, and the greater part must get
it second-hand—must avail themselves of the labors of others who have
delved in these unfamiliar fields.</p>

<p>It is to facilitate and popularize this study of general literature by furnishing
a complete and carefully condensed text-book on the subject, unencumbered
by obscure names and wearisome details, that the volume now
offered to the public has been prepared. It presents a full account of the
literatures of ancient nations, and, treating of the origin and relationships of
their respective languages, incidentally brings forward some of the most interesting
facts of Comparative Philology. While the writings of Greece and
Rome receive due attention, a new, and, it is believed, peculiarly valuable
feature of the book will be found in its treatment of ancient Oriental literature—particularly
the Sanscrit and Persian. The labors of European
scholars during the last quarter-century have thrown a chain of living interest
around the subject, and awakened on this side of the Atlantic as well a
thirst for further knowledge, which it is here attempted to satisfy. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
principles of Egyptian writing are also explained; and the literary treasures
recently unearthed amid the ruins of the Nile Valley and elsewhere are
described and illustrated.</p>

<p>In treating the subject the author has aimed, while giving a clear outline
of each literature as a whole, to make its great writers stand out in bold
relief, and to associate them in the pupil’s mind with the works that have
made them immortal. With this view brief biographies, not fragmentary
or isolated, but grafted on the narrative where they naturally belong, are
accompanied with short specimens, carefully selected to give the best idea
of each author’s style and genius. In the critical views as well as the historical
facts presented, the latest authorities have been followed, and the
aid of maps and illustrations has been freely resorted to for the better elucidation
of points on which they could throw light.</p>

<p>The present volume has grown out of the author’s experience in the lecture-room;
and in the belief that it is of a scope and grade that will meet
the popular want, he now offers it to high-schools, academies, and colleges.
From such institutions he feels that no class should graduate in ignorance
either of the Greek and Roman classics which have inspired the modern
poet and philosopher, or of those precious remains of once great Oriental
literatures that patient scholars of the nineteenth century have brought to
light—that helped to shape the Greek mind itself in the morning of the
world. He trusts that it may foster in the young admiration of the brilliant
thoughts that sparkle in the pages of ancient lore, a love of literature, and
a taste for philological investigations.</p>

<p class="pdate"><span class="smcap">Columbia College</span>, <i>June, 1878</i>.</p>


<p>In order that the friends of this popular work on Ancient Literature may
be advised of the progress made in philological study during the present
decade, the author has thoroughly revised the text, diagrams, and maps. The
value of the revision is enhanced by the introduction of a carefully selected
bibliography; frequent references to standard monographs—not made to
supply omissions, but as guides to those who may desire a full and authoritative
course of collateral reading—are incorporated in the narrative.
Attention is especially directed to the chapter on Egyptian writing and literature,
for which the author is extensively indebted to F. C. H. Wendel,
Ph.D. (Strasburg). The results of the vast amount of labor expended in
this most interesting and important field during the ten years that have
elapsed since the issue of this text-book, are here for the first time given to
English readers. Other specialists have materially aided the author in his
work of revision. Acknowledgment is due to Dr. H. T. Peck, Professor of
the Latin Language and Literature, and Dr. R. J. H. Gottheil, Professor of
Syriac and Rabbinical Literature, Columbia College; to Drs. E. D. Perry
and A. V. W. Jackson, instructors respectively in Sanscrit and Avesta,
Columbia College; and to Dr. Chas. E. Moldehnke, the Egyptologist.</p>

</div>


<p>Literature, in its broadest sense, comprises the written
productions of all nations in all ages. It is the permanent
expression of the intellectual power of man, and reflects the
popular manners, the political condition, the moral and religious
status. In its literary productions, a nation bequeaths
to posterity an ever-speaking record of its inner life.</p>

<p>The history of literature traces the progress of the human
mind from age to age, by landmarks erected by the mind itself.
It represents the development of different phases of
thought in written language, and shows their influence in
moulding the public taste and morals. It investigates the
connection between the literatures of different countries, considers
the causes of their growth and their decay, and critically
examines the works of individual authors.</p>

<p>Literature may be divided into two parts, Ancient and
Modern. The former, to which this volume is devoted, includes
the literatures of the ancient Oriental nations, the
Greeks, and the Romans. To the second division belong
the literatures of modern Europe, of the modern Oriental
nations, and of America.</p>

<p>After considering the origin and relationship of languages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
we shall give a brief summary of the history of ancient literature
as a whole, without national divisions; so that the
reader, having previously followed the progress of letters
from age to age and people to people, may be enabled to
study more intelligently the separate literatures of the different
countries.</p>


<h4>ORIGIN AND RELATIONSHIP OF LANGUAGES.</h4>

<p><b>The Dawn of History.</b>—When the mist that envelops the
early history of the world first rises, it discovers to our view,
in parts of western Asia, communities more or less advanced
in knowledge and the arts, gathered about certain centres of
civilization; and others, of less culture, leading a wandering
life, spent mostly, we may conjecture, in the chase, in predatory
excursions, and the tending of herds. We find at this
time a thrifty race, called Aryans (<i>är’yanz</i>), settled in the district
between the Hindoo Koosh Mountains and the upper
course of the Amoo—the ancient Bactria (part of what is
now Turkestan and Afghanistan; see Map, p. 15). The region
watered by the rivers Euphrates and Tigris was occupied
by the forefathers of the Chaldeans and Assyrians, the
Jews and Arabians; while over the plains of Tartary, known
as Turan, wandering tribes were spread—whence their name,
Turanians, <i>swift horsemen</i>. Corresponding with these three
divisions of the human race are three distinct families of
languages,—the <span class="smcap">Aryan</span> or <span class="smcap">Indo-European</span>, the <span class="smcap">Semitic</span>,
and the <span class="smcap">Turanian</span>,—embracing more than one hundred and
fifty tongues. (<i>See Rawlinson’s “The Origin of Nations.”</i>)</p>

<p>In Africa, also, civilization was a plant of early growth, Egypt
ranking among the most ancient monarchies. Europe, however,
in these primeval ages, was either a tenantless wilderness
or the home of rude adventurers like the Lapps and Finns, of
whom the Basques in the Pyrenees are perhaps the only remnants
in the west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>


<h4>THE ARYANS.</h4>

<p><b>The Aryans</b> have left no account of themselves sculptured
on rocks or the walls of crumbling temples; but by careful
study of the languages of Aryan origin we obtain, after the
lapse of four thousand years, a glimpse of the social condition
of those who spoke the mother-tongue among the mountains
of Bactria. We infer that nouns similar in the various derived
languages,—as father (<i>protector</i>), brother (<i>helper</i>), house,
door, walls, boat, grain, etc.,—are the names of objects or notions
familiar to the original family.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Thus utilizing language
as a key to what would otherwise be locked up in the unknown
past, we learn that the inhabitants of the fertile Bactrian valleys
were devoted to agricultural pursuits. Tilling the ground
was an honorable employment, the very name <i>Aryan</i> signifying
<i>high-born</i>, <i>noble</i>. We have pictured to us law-abiding communities,
grouped together in towns, ruled by chiefs and a
king, recognizing family ties, entertaining exalted conceptions
of woman, and a solemn regard for the marriage bond—the
latter always a mark of high civilization.</p>

<p>Language also tells us that this interesting people preferred
the arts of peace to war. With the dog for his companion, the
shepherd folded his flocks of sheep; with the horse and ox
for his servants, the landholder broke the soil with a plough
of bronze. Pigs and fowls were raised; cattle formed the
chief wealth; and the cows were milked by the <i>daughter</i> of
the household—this name meaning <i>milk-maid</i>.</p>

<p>The Aryan drove from village to village in his wheeled car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>riage,
over well-constructed roads; worked the metals; plied
the loom; moulded clay into pottery; and even navigated
the neighboring waters in boats propelled by oars. He gave
names to numbers as far as one hundred, was familiar with
the principles of decimals, and took the moon for his guide in
dividing the year into months.</p>

<p>A Supreme Being was worshipped in Bactria, the Great
Unseen, the Creator and Governor of the world. In the reference
to him of controversies that were difficult to settle, we
trace the origin of the later trial by ordeal. Even some of
our commonest stories are derived from fables current at
least two thousand years B.C. in ancient Arya.</p>

<p><b>Aryan Migrations.</b>—Few in number at first, the Aryans
long lived peaceably together. But as the population grew
denser, great bodies, either compelled to search for food in
other lands or moved by a thirst for exploration, broke away
at different periods from the cradle of their race, in quest of
new abodes.</p>

<p>Among these emigrants were Teutonic, Lithuanian, and
Slavonian hordes, who pushed to the northwest, and became
the ancestors of the Scandinavian and German nations, the
Letts, Russians, and Poles. The Celts and Græco-Italic
tribes, probably passing between the Caspian Sea and the
Black, made their way by different routes into the fertile regions
of southern and southwestern Europe. The Slavs, Teutons,
and Celts, appear to have dispossessed an indigenous
population of supposed Turanian origin.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Of the Aryans who
migrated to the northwest, Max Müller says that they “have
been the prominent actors in the great drama of history, and
have carried to their fullest growth all the elements of active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
life with which our nature is endowed. They have perfected
society and morals. They have become, after struggles with
Semitic and Turanian races, the rulers of history; and it seems
to be their mission to link all parts of the world together by
the chains of civilization, commerce, and religion.”</p>


<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p015" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <img src="images/i_p015.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ORIGINAL HOME of the ARYAN TRIBES<br />
with their ROUTES OF MIGRATION.</div>
</div>

<p>After the last emigration of Aryans to the west, the parent
community extended its settlements southward into the Tableland
of Iran (<i>érahn</i>) (modern Persia, Afghanistan, and Beloochistan;
see Map), and finally, in consequence of a religious
difference, separated into two great branches. One remained
on the Iranian plateau, and was ultimately known in history
as the Medes and Persians. The other made its way through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the mountain-passes, crossed the upper Indus (at some uncertain
date, between 2000 and 1400 B.C.), and in time effected
the conquest of the rich peninsula of Hindostan. The invaders
were the “fair-complexioned” Indo-Aryans, who spoke the
polished Sanscrit, and among whom sprung up the institution
of caste and many gross superstitions.</p>


<p><b>Aryan Languages.</b>—Similarity in the words and grammatical
structure of their languages proves that the Hindoos, the
Persians, the Greeks and Romans, the Celtic races, the Slavonian
and Teutonic nations,—all had a common origin; that
the frozen Icelander and Indian fire-worshipper, the outcast
Gypsy and the plaided Highlander, the English master and
his Cooley servant, are brothers of the same stock. Their
tongues have been derived from the same parent—a language
full of poetic grandeur, older than Greek or Sanscrit, and containing
the germs of both—a language which has perished.</p>

<p>Spoken as we have seen from India to the west of Europe,
these tongues have been called <span class="smcap">Indo-European</span>. They embrace
the dialects of India and Persia; the Welsh, and the
Celtic of Scotland and Ireland; the Latin and its derivatives,
the Romance languages, viz., Italian, Spanish, French, etc.;
Greek; Russian and Polish; English, German, Danish, and
Swedish (see diagram preceding the title-page).</p>

<p>Some philologists hold that the primitive home of the Indo-European
race cannot be determined, and incline to the opinion
that the Asiatic representatives of the family emigrated
from Europe into Asia. (<i>Consult Brugman’s “Elements of the
Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages,” p. 2.</i>)</p>


<h4>THE SEMITES.</h4>

<p><b>The Semitic Languages</b>, in like manner, may all be traced
to a common source. To this group belong the Syriac, the
Hebrew, the Arabic, the Ethiopic, the ancient Phœnician, and
the Carthaginian; while the cuneiform inscriptions of Bab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>ylonia
and Assyria are the written characters of a Semitic
tongue common to those countries. (See Chart, p. 85.)</p>

<p>Philology has not followed the Semites to a home as limited
as that of the Aryans; though tradition points to Armenia as
their early domicile, ethnological science to Arabia or Africa.
It declares, however, the Semitic and the Aryan to be distinct
forms of speech, perhaps branches of a common stem, but
neither derivable from the other.</p>


<h4>THE TURANIANS.</h4>

<p><b>Turanian Dialects.</b>—Here there is slighter evidence of relationship.
The Turanian languages, though they seem to be
members of the same original family, differ widely; for those
who spoke them were nomads, wanderers over the globe,
whose customs, laws, and dialects were modified with every
change of habitation and condition. To this sporadic group
belong the Mongolian tongues, the Turkish, Finnic, and Hungarian,
together with certain Polynesian dialects; but the
Chinese, Japanese, Australian, North American Indian, South
African, and many others of the nine hundred languages
spoken on the earth, bear hardly enough resemblance to
these to be classed in the same family.</p>


<h4>SYSTEMS OF WRITING.</h4>

<p><b>Language</b> is either spoken or written. Spoken language
we find to have been used as a medium of communication between
men in the earliest periods to which history carries us
back. It is the expression of reason, and as such constitutes
a line of demarcation between man and the lower animals.
Without it, indeed, the brute can, to a certain extent, make
known his emotions and desires. The house-dog, by the distinctive
character of his bark, welcomes his master or threatens
the intrusive stranger. The hen warns her chicks of danger
by one set of signals, and calls them to feed by another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
The ant, discovering an inviting grain too heavy for itself
alone, bears the intelligence to its fellows and promptly returns
with aid. But such limited means of communication fall infinitely
short of the perfect system which is exclusively man’s
birthright—which uses articulate sounds to represent ideas,
and combines them so as to express every shade of thought.</p>


<p><b>Written Language.</b>—Spoken Language lives only for the
moment; words uttered to-day die and are forgotten to-morrow.
To give permanency to his passing thoughts, when advancing
civilization showed such permanency to be desirable,
man devised Writing, the art of representing ideas by visible
characters. Written Language is the vehicle of literature—the
material in which the thinker embodies his conceptions
for future generations, just as the sculptor gives permanent
forms to his ideals in marble, or the painter on the glowing
canvas.</p>

<p>Writing is either Ideographic or Phonetic. The Ideographic
System represents material objects <i>directly</i>, by pictures
or symbols. The Phonetic System uses certain characters
to express the articulate sounds by which such objects
or notions are denoted, and thus <i>indirectly</i>, through the two
media of sounds and characters, indicates the objects or notions
themselves.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ideographic Writing.</span>—It has long been contended that
the earliest method of conveying ideas was by means of pictorial
images, and there is no reason for disputing such a
theory. But this is not <i>written</i> language; it is mere thought-painting,
or the representation of objects and actions by pictures,
and may satisfy the wants of primitive races in conveying
a limited amount of information. Thus the American
Indians informed one another of the presence and movements
of troops, or of engagements that had taken place, by means
of pictures. The emblems employed were generally understood
among the different tribes: <i>e.g.</i>, a tree with human legs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
stood for a botanist; and the figure of a man with two bars
on the stomach and four across the legs, was a prescription
ordering abstinence from food for two days, and rest for four.
The original characters of the Egyptians and Chinese, of the
cuneiform systems, and of the Aztecs, were, in like manner,
<i>mere pictures</i>, and nothing more.</p>

<p>The test of a written language is its ability to express abstract
thoughts by single signs or combinations of signs; in
this direction, rude symbols are found utterly wanting. It
may be that picture-drawing gave the first impulse to the invention
of phonetic writing; yet the origin of such writing,
with its gradual development, is as hidden from us as that of
language itself. We are justified, however, in assuming that
wherever we have history, we have also written language.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Phonetic Writing.</span>—There are two systems of phonetic
writing, the Syllabic and the Alphabetic. The characters of
the former are used to represent <i>syllables</i>, or combinations of
sounds (either words or parts of words) uttered by distinct impulses
of the voice; those of the latter represent the elements
of which these syllables are composed, or <i>letters</i>. History indicates
that written language is always phonetic. In Egypt
it is both syllabic and alphabetic; in Babylon, syllabic alone.</p>

<p>The characters by which the elementary sounds of any language
are denoted, arranged in order, constitute its Alphabet.
A perfect alphabet would be one in which every letter represented
but one simple sound, and every simple sound was
represented by but one letter—a perfection never yet attained.</p>

<p>It is to the Egyptians that the world is indebted for Alphabetic
Writing. Their hieroglyphics were partly alphabetic,
partly syllabic, and partly determinative, the latter, in the
course of centuries, becoming word-signs or ideograms (see
p. 120). From a modification of their alphabet employed by
them in transliterating Semitic words and names, the Phœnician
alphabet was derived. This modified alphabet, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
several syllabic signs, consisted of about thirty characters. It
has been conjectured that Phœnicians, dwelling or trading in
Egypt, saw the advantage of written language, and employed
this transliteration alphabet to write their own tongue. All
the modifications introduced by them are graphic in nature,
and designed to simplify the original characters. It is further
important to note that the Phœnician alphabet is not
derived from the hieroglyphics, but from the second form of
the hieratic (see p. 122, and table, p. 87, where the theory is
illustrated). The Hittite hieroglyphics (p. 114) may be derived
from the Egyptian; but other ancient Oriental alphabets,
as the Babylonian, the Chinese, and perhaps the Sanscrit,
were possibly independently invented and developed.</p>

<p>Such is the most probable account of the origin of letters.
Tradition variously ascribes their invention to Thoth, an
Egyptian god, to Cadmus of Phœnicia, to Odin the supreme
deity of the Scandinavians, and to others. Of the varied exports
of the Phœnicians, their alphabet was the most precious.
Wherever their sails were spread, their letters were made
known, and all nations sooner or later profited by this great
Semitic invention. In the table on page 87 may be traced
a decided resemblance between several of the Phœnician
characters and the hieroglyphics in which they originated;
also the successive changes by which they were modified in
the earlier and later Greek and Latin letters—whence most
of our English capitals. (<i>See Taylor’s “The Alphabet.”</i>)</p>


<p><b>Modes of Writing and Pointing.</b>—As regards the direction
in which their writing ran, ancient nations differed. In the
Egyptian hieroglyphics there was no established order; but
the figures of men and animals, facing the beginning of the
lines, often gave a clue to the direction in which they were
meant to be read. As a general rule, the Indo-Europeans
wrote from left to right, the Semites from right to left. The
Laws of Solon and other Greek writings of that period (about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
600 B.C.) appeared in lines running alternately from right to
left and from left to right, as an ox walks in ploughing; this
“ox-turning system” (<i>boustrophedon</i>), however, was soon followed
by our present method. The Chinese, Japanese, and
Mongols, wrote in columns, which were read from the top
of the page, and from right to left. In the ancient Mexican
pictographs, similar columns were read from the bottom.</p>

<p>The ancients did not separate sentences, or their subdivisions,
with points; but wrote their words together, leaving
the meaning to be deciphered from the context. Rings, ovals,
or squares, were sometimes drawn around proper names, and
words were occasionally separated by some device—a diagonal
bar or wedge <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p021a.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>, as in ancient Persian inscriptions; or
a letter placed on its side, as between the following words:
CONJUGI<span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p021b.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>KARISSIMAE. In a Roman inscription found
near Bath, England, a small <i>v</i> occurs after every word:
JULIUSvVITALISvFABRI. A peculiar sign was used,
in some cases, immediately before the name of a god or of
a person.</p>

<p>In the third century B.C., a system of punctuation, devised
by Aristophanes, a grammarian of Alexandria, became known
to the Greeks. It employed a dot (.), which had the force of
our period, colon, or comma, according as it was placed after
the top, middle, or bottom of the final word. The better system
of modern times was not invented till the sixteenth century.</p>


<h4>ANCIENT WRITING MATERIALS.</h4>

<p><b>Stylus and Tablets.</b>—The first writing was done on rocks
with sharp-pointed instruments of iron or bronze, to record
great events. Next came tracings on bricks of soft clay, afterward
sun-dried or baked; and then writing with a metal
or ivory <i>stylus</i> on sheets of lead or layers of wax, from which
erasures could be made, if needful, with the flattened end of
the instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Pliny speaks of leaden sheets, thus inscribed, rolled up in a
cylindrical form when not in use. But under provocation the
metallic stylus could be employed as a dagger; and when a
Roman schoolmaster was killed by his pupils with their styles
and heavy table-books, the dangerous instrument was banished,
and superseded by a similar one of horn. The early
shepherds, we are told, imitated this mode of writing, making
thorns or awls do duty as styles, and scratching their songs
on leather straps which they wound round their crooks.</p>

<p>Wooden tablets, glazed to receive coloring matter, were
used by the Jews and early Egyptians, and the former wrote
also with a diamond-tipped stylus on stone or metallic tables.
The Greeks and Romans sometimes wired their tablets of
citron-wood, beech, or fir, together at the back, so as to allow
them to open like a modern book.</p>

<p><b>Calamus, or Reed.</b>—A great advance was made when the
stylus gave way to camel’s hair brushes or reeds (<i>calami</i>)
sharpened and split like our pens, and the tablets were replaced
with papyrus and parchment. The reeds in common
use came from Egypt, but persons of fortune often wrote with
a silver calamus. The ink employed was thicker and more
lasting than ours; sometimes prepared from the black fluid
of the cuttle-fish, but generally from lampblack and glue, or
from soot, rosin, and pitch.—Chalk pencils were at one time
manufactured by the Egyptians and Greeks.</p>

<p>With the reed and ink, bark came into use as a cheap
writing material; hence the Latin word for bark, <i>liber</i>, meant
also book. Leaves, too, were employed for this purpose, particularly
those of the palm—whence, perhaps, the <i>leaf</i> of a
book was so called. But for manuscripts designed for permanent
preservation, papyrus had the decided preference.</p>

<div class="figright illowp50" id="i_p023" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p023.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Egyptian Papyrus.</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>Papyrus</b>, or the <i>paper</i>-plant, the bulrush of Scripture, grew
in the marshes and pools of Egypt. Its branchless stem
rose from five to ten feet above the water, and was sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>mounted
by a cluster of long, spike-shaped, drooping leaves.
This plant was woven
into sandals, mats, clothing,
and even boats; was
eaten, raw and boiled;
was manufactured into
furniture; and was burned
for fuel and light;
when prepared for writing
purposes, it was invaluable.
The part under
the water was selected,
the outer bark
removed, and the delicate
white layers found
beneath were pressed together
into sheets and
dried. These were written
on with red and black ink, and some of them were
elaborately ornamented with many-colored figures.</p>

<p>The finest papyrus was reserved for the priests, and never
exported till they had used it. But the Romans, having invented
a process for removing what was first written on it,
imported it in large quantities; they also attempted its cultivation
in the marshes of the Tiber, but without success.
The Greeks did not use it extensively until the era of the
Ptolemies.</p>

<p><b>Parchment</b> was prepared from the skins of sheep and
goats by polishing them with pumice-stone and then rubbing
in fragrant oil. Its name, in Latin <i>pergamena</i>, would
seem to indicate Pergamus in western Asia as the place of
its origin; but centuries before that little kingdom became
celebrated for its library of parchment volumes, this material,
or something very like it, was known. Herodotus mentions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
its use in his time; and the Jews, as a pastoral people familiar
with the art of dressing skins, wrote their first books
on a kind of leather.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p024" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p024.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Reading a Volumen, or Roll.</span></div>
</div>

<p>But if parchment was not invented at Pergamus, Eu’menes,
king of that country, was certainly the first to make extensive
use of it (175 B.C.). He had founded a splendid library,
which he determined should eclipse that of Alexandria.
In the reign of Ptolemy Epiph’anes, king of Egypt, it was
sought to prevent the transcription of books for the rival
library by prohibiting the exportation of papyrus. This
obliged Eumenes to resort to parchment as a substitute.
From Pergamus it spread to Europe, finally superseding all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
other materials, and continuing in demand until the art of
making paper cheaply from rags was invented toward the
close of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Ancient manuscripts were put up in the form of rolls
(<i>volu’mina</i>—whence <i>volumes</i>), made of sheets fastened together
in a continuous strip, sometimes forty or fifty yards
in length. This was wound round wooden cylinders, the
ends of which were often set with jewels, or ornamented with
knobs of ivory, silver, or gold. Titles were either suspended
from these books like tags, or glued upon them as labels.
An outside cover of parchment protected the scrolls, which,
enclosed in cylindrical cases and placed horizontally on
shelves ranged about a room, constituted an ancient library.</p>

<p>The Chinese, after writing for centuries, in common with
their neighbors of India, on bark and dried palm-leaves, are
believed to have discovered a process of preparing a pulp
from cotton or bamboo, and to have manufactured it into
paper as early as the commencement of our era. Perhaps,
as observation of the silkworm spinning her cocoons led
them to devise the art of weaving silk, they in like manner
borrowed his cunning from the paper-making wasp, and thus
early perfected an invention which has been of incalculable
service to literature.</p>


<h4>GENERAL VIEW OF THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT
LITERATURE.</h4>

<p>A comprehensive glance over the entire field whose treasures
we are about to examine in detail, will enable us the
better to appreciate and remember their relative age and
value. Beginning, then, with the most distant periods, we
find a literature developed in Mesopota’mia, Egypt, Iran, and
China, even before 2000 B.C. At that date, the valley of the
Euphrates and Tigris was the seat of a civilized Turanian
people, the inventors of the complex system of cuneiform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
writing, thought by some to be the oldest in the world.
These Turanian Chaldees, mingled with a Semitic race, were
then beginning to enjoy their golden age of letters; at the
same time, the ancient Persians and Hindoos were composing
hymns; the sages of China were busy on their sacred
books; and Egypt had made considerable advance in both
poetry and prose.</p>

<p>To trace the progress of literature in these remote times
from century to century is impossible. Five hundred years,
however, bring us to the Augustan era of romance and satire,
epic and devotional poetry, in Egypt: they introduce us to
Zoroas’ter, the founder or reformer of the ancient Persian
religion, whose teachings are set forth in the Aves’ta; to the
Ve’da, or Brahman Bible; to Moses and the Pentateuch;
and to Phœnician theology, science, and poetry. Meanwhile
Chaldean literature declines, and Assyrian letters come into
view. During the next five centuries, poetry and science
continue to flourish in Egypt, though not perhaps with their
pristine vigor; Phœnicia maintains her literary reputation;
the Veda grows; and Persian priests are occupied in enlarging
and modifying their sacred texts.</p>

<p>1000 B.C. was the era of great epics. The epic, or narrative
poem, based on some important event (in Greek, επος)
or chain of events, though first appearing in Egypt, was
brought to perfection, about this time, by the Greeks, and
some say by the Hindoos also, Aryan nations holding no intercourse
with each other. Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey were
paralleled by two stupendous Indian poems, the Râmâyana
(<i>rah-mah’-yă-nă</i>) and the Mahâbhârata (<i>mă-hah’bah’ră-tă</i>).<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
To these, all dazzling with Oriental splendor, the epics of the
Greek bard may yield in luxuriance of fancy and gorgeous
imagery; but in power of description, sublimity of thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and attractive simplicity of expression, Homer was without
an equal.</p>

<p>While, then, the Semitic nations as a rule employed prose
as the vehicle of their earliest records of events, Greece and
India, types of the Aryan stock, transmitted their legends
to posterity in epic verse. Later times have not failed to perpetuate
the taste, and measurably the ability; epic poetry has
been cultivated by all the Indo-European nations, and to them
it has been confined.—Contemporaneously with Homer, native
poets were inditing ballads and pastorals in China, and the
Hebrews enjoyed their golden age of secular and religious
poetry; Egypt had entered on her literary, as well as her political,
decline.</p>

<p>Henceforth our interest centres principally in Greece. Until
800 B.C., the poems of Homer and of Hesiod, his contemporary
or immediate successor, constituted the bulk of Hellenic
literature. Then began a transition to a poetry more
natural—a poetry of the emotions—on themes that kindled
love, anger, hatred, grief, hope; and for three centuries <i>lyrics</i>
in different forms echoed throughout the land. Archil’ochus
poured forth his caustic satires; Tyrtæus, his inspiriting war-songs;
Sappho, her passionate strains; Anacreon, the joys of
the winecup; Simon’ides breathed his touching laments; and
Pindar stirred the soul with his grand odes, as with the sound
of the trumpet. Prose also received attention, and Ionian
authors took the initiative in systematic historical composition.
Rude religious festivals suggested dramatic representations;
and the pioneers in tragedy and comedy rode about the
country, exhibiting their novel art on carts which carried
the performers and their machinery.—Meanwhile in the
East, Assyrian literature reached its highest development
at Nineveh, to be buried beneath the ruins of that city,
625 B.C. Letters then revived at Babylon, and for nearly a
century flourished there; Jewish poetry declined; and Con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>fucius,
the philosopher of transcendent wisdom, appeared in
China.</p>

<p>Early in the 5th century, Greece plunged into a struggle for
life or death with the Persian Empire—a struggle from which
she emerged covered with glory, united and free. Her triumph
is straightway sung in immortal verse, and historians
arise to record her exploits. Athens, who faced the enemy at
Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa, and drove him back crippled
and disgraced to Asia, now becomes the leader of grateful
Hellas, and the centre of literature and refinement. Blossom
after blossom unfolds in her genial clime. She makes ample
amends for her barrenness in the past by unprecedented fruitfulness,
and gives to the nations a drama, lustrous with the
names of Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides (<i>es’ke-lus</i>, <i>sof’o-kleez</i>,
<i>eu-rip’e-deez</i>)—the great tragic trio of antiquity. Comedy also,
as represented by Aristophanes, is perfected in her theatre.</p>

<p>Then come the Peloponnesian War and the consequent humiliation
of Athens; the overthrow of her democratic government,
and the partial decline of literature, particularly poetry,
with the fall of free institutions. Still, writers of genius are
not wanting. The graphic pens of Thucydides and Xenophon
lend additional graces to the history of Greece; Plato and
Aristotle make her name immortal in philosophy; and the
world’s greatest orators electrify her assemblies with their eloquence.
Demosthenes, prince of them all, stands forth as the
champion of Grecian liberty, and thunders his Philippics at the
wily Macedonian who would enthrall his country. But the
star of Macedon was in the ascendant. Chærone’a decided
the fate of Greece; and she who had withstood the legions
of Xerxes, gave way before the invincible phalanx of Philip
and Alexander.</p>

<p>A sad period of decadence followed. Alexandria, in Egypt,
founded by the conqueror whose name it bore (332 B.C.), became
the centre of learning as well as commerce; and Athens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
yielded to her fate, wasting her time in empty philosophical
discussions and the pursuit of pleasure. Poetry languished,
yet flashed out occasionally in epic or didactic form, bringing
to mind the glories of the past. It is true that in the idyls of
Theocritus (<i>little pictures of domestic life</i>) pastoral verse now
bloomed for the first time on European soil, and with fine effect;
but it was in far-off Syracuse, not in classic Greece.
Here the deepening twilight was fatal to literary growth; and
when Egypt fell beneath the power of Rome in the first century
B.C., Greek letters sought a new asylum in the city of
Romulus.</p>

<p>Turning to Rome, we find that she had long displayed an
appreciation of Grecian genius as well as a striking talent for
imitation. About the middle of the third century B.C., with
little or no literature of her own, she gladly appropriated the
foreign treasures held up before her admiring eyes by Liv’ius
Androni’cus, a Tarentine Greek, whom the fortunes of war had
made the slave of a Roman master. This most ancient of
Latin poets put upon the stage versions of the Greek dramas,
and with his translation of the Odyssey took his captors captive.
Nævius and Ennius, following in the path thus opened,
gave Italy its first epics; Ter’ence and Plautus made the people
familiar with the humors of comedy; and Cato imparted
dignity to Latin prose.</p>

<p>Oratory, for which the Romans had a natural aptitude, culminated
in the speeches of Cicero, who ushered in the golden
age. In his writings, as well as in the histories of Cæsar,
Sallust, and Livy, prose now attracted with its finished periods.
Nor was poetry less notably represented. Catullus, vehement
and pathetic by turns, transplanted the ode and epigram to
Italy; Lucre’tius threw into verse his ideal of philosophy;
Tibullus excelled in simplicity and tenderness; while Virgil
and Horace rivalled, as they doubtless imitated, the first poets
of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Virgil’s epic, the Æne’id, as remarkable for beauty as Homer’s
is for grandeur, secured to its author the first place
among Latin poets; and next to him stands Horace, with his
faultless mastery of metre and keen observation of men and
manners. Their genius shed on the court of the first emperor,
Augustus, a peculiar lustre, still recognized in our application
of the epithet <i>Augustan</i> to the most brilliant period of
a nation’s literature.</p>

<p>It is not strange that under the tyranny of the Cæsars literary
decay set in; yet Rome’s silver age was kept bright by
the labors of Persius and Juvenal, the unsparing satirists;
Lucan, author of the epic Pharsalia; the grave and accurate
historian Tacitus; the two Plinies; and Quintilian, the
rhetorician. Taste, however, had sadly deteriorated; genius
died with patriotism; and despots sought in vain to restore
for their own corrupt purposes the ancient spirit which they
had crushed out. At length the degenerate Latin writers laid
aside their own manly tongue for Greek; and the list of the
monuments of Roman genius was complete.</p>

<p>Such has been, in general, the course of every literature.
We trace successively the birth of poetry; the gradual perfecting
of prose; the ripening of simplicity into elegance;
the perversion of elegance into affectation; the language and
literature, losing the vigor of manhood, affected with the
feebleness of age, and either succumbing at once to some
great civil convulsion or perishing by a slow but no less
certain living death. As with political, so with literary
history:—</p>

<h4>THE SANSCRIT LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p><b>Characteristics.</b>—Oldest of all the Indo-European tongues,
and most closely resembling the common parent that is lost,
is <span class="smcap">Sanscrit</span>—the language spoken by those fair-skinned Aryans
who more than thirty centuries ago, swarming through the
Hindoo Koosh passes, made the sunny plains of Hindostan
their own (page 16). Sanscrit spread over most of the peninsula;
and the meaning of the word, <i>perfected</i>, is significant of
the flexibility, refinement, regularity, and philosophical system
of grammar, by which the language was distinguished. In
luxuriance of inflection it was unequalled. Its nouns were
varied according to eight cases, and three numbers (singular,
dual, and plural); and its verbs, which assumed causal, desiderative,
and frequentative forms, were carried in conjugation
through three voices, the active, middle, and passive. Its
chief fault—a result of its very richness—lay in the frequent
use of long compounds, particularly adjectives, presenting what
seems to us a confused combination of ideas, sometimes ludicrously
lengthened out; as in the expressions, “always-to-be-remembered-with-reverence
patriot,” “water-play-delighted <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>maidenn-bathing-fragrant
river-breezes” (that is, <i>river-breezes
made fragrant by the bathing of maidens delighted with sporting
in the water</i>). (<i>Consult Dr. Perry’s “Sanscrit Primer.”</i>)</p>

  <img src="images/i_p032.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Brahman Priest.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Neither the parallelism of Hebrew poetry (page 89) nor the
rhyme of modern times finds a place in Sanscrit verse; it is
distinguished from prose, like Greek poetry, simply by a metrical
arrangement of long and short syllables. The measured
cadence gave great delight to the cultivated ear of the Hindoos.
“There are two
excellent things in the
world,” says one of their
writers—“the friendship
of the good, and the beauties
of poetry.”</p>

<p>Sanscrit is now a dead
language. About three
hundred years before the
Christian era, dialects similarly
derived took its place
among the people, and it
has since been kept alive
only in the conversation
and writings of the learned,
as the sacred language
of the Brahmans, or priestly
caste.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Yet so extensive
is its literature that it costs a Brahman half his life to
master a portion of its sacred books alone.</p>


<p><b>Sanscrit Alphabet.</b>—As to the origin of the Sanscrit alphabet,
consisting of fifty letters, history is silent. It is believed
that the entire early literature was preserved for centuries by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
oral repetition. When their polished tongue was first expressed
in written characters—derived from the Phœnicians
or independently invented—so perfectly did these answer the
purpose that the Hindoos styled their alphabet “the writing
of the gods.” The Sanscrit letters are still preserved in the
written language of the pure Hindoos, but in that of the Mohammedan
population have been replaced with the Arabic
characters.</p>


<p><b>History of Sanscrit Researches.</b>—Arabian translations of
Sanscrit works were made as early as the reign of the Caliph
Haroun’-al-Raschid, at Bagdad (800 A.D.), and appeared from
time to time in the succeeding centuries. Europeans first
knew of the existence of Sanscrit and its literature during the
reign of Au’rungzebe (1658-1707), in whose time the French
and English obtained a foothold in Hindostan. Before this,
the Jesuit Nobili (<i>no’be-le</i>) had gone to India to study the sacred
books with a view to the conversion of the Hindoos, and,
having mastered them, boldly preached a new Veda; but he
died on the scene of his labors, and Europe profited nothing
by his researches. It was left for the Asiatic Society, organized
at Calcutta in 1784 by Sir William Jones, to open the
eyes of Europe to the importance and magnitude of Brahman
literature, of which the translation of Sakoon’talâ (page 50) by
this great orientalist gave a most favorable specimen.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of the English scholar just mentioned,
the German critic Schlegel, in his “Language and Wisdom
of the Indians” (1808) laid the permanent foundations of
<span class="smcap">Comparative Philology</span>, a science of recent birth but one
that has been of incalculable service to history, establishing
the kinship of the Hindoos and Persians with the old Greeks
and Romans, as well as the modern nations of the west, by
striking resemblances in their respective tongues. Eminent
scholars have since prosecuted the work with enthusiasm—especially Bopp,
Humboldt, Pott, and Grimm among the Ger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>mans,
the French savant Bournouf, Max Müller in England,
and the American Whitney. Sanscrit is no longer a sealed
volume. The leading European universities have their professors
of that tongue, who lecture also on comparative grammar.

<h4>SACRED LITERATURE OF THE HINDOOS.</h4>


<p><b>The Veda.</b>—The language of the ancient Indo-Aryans survives
in the Ve’da, the oldest work of Indo-European literature,
dating back to the prehistoric era of the Aryan race.
The Veda, while rich in striking imagery, is marked by a
beautiful simplicity of diction. In its language, we behold the
most ancient form of our own tongue; in the hymns of its
poets, those germs of Aryan intellectual development that no
long time after bloomed in epic and idyl through the fertile
valleys of India, bore immortal fruit on the soil of Greece and
Rome, and have been brought to perfection in the grand productions
of modern genius. (The student is referred to <i>Max
Müller’s “Rig-Veda-Sanhita,”</i> and <i>Dr. Arrowsmith’s Translation
of Prof. Kaegi’s “Rig-Veda.”</i>)</p>

<p>The word <i>Veda</i> means <i>knowledge</i>. The Mantra, or “song”
portion of the Veda, is divided into four parts: the Rig-Veda
(<i>knowledge of the stanzas</i>), or Veda of hymns; the Sâma-Veda,
of tunes or chants, and the Yajur-Veda, of sacrificial
rites (prayers)—both purely ritualistic; and the Artharva-Veda,
in the main a collection of incantations and spells:
Each of the last-named Vedas is a medley of extracts from
the Rig-Veda, with additions from outside sources. Thus it
will be seen that the Hindoos were believers in the efficacy
of sacrifices, some of which were prolonged for months and
even years, as well as of talismans, charms, and incantations
to ward off disease, bring riches, and inspire love.</p>

<p>To the metrical parts of the Vedas are attached the Brâhmanas,
which abound in tedious descriptions of rites, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
were written long after in prose to explain the hymns. There
are also collections of rules for worship and sacrifice; and
speculations on philosophy and religion, which display no
little acuteness, for the Hindoo mind seems to have been
prone to metaphysical investigation and ingenious in reasoning
even to the verge of sophistry. Supplements to the
Vedas contain abundant commentaries on their grammar and
language, as well as astronomical facts—the latter mainly
borrowed from other nations and not based on original researches
or discoveries. Finally, the Upave’das (<i>oo-pă-vā’dăz</i>—<i>appended</i>)
treat of diseases and their cure, devotional music,
the use of weapons, and the arts; while the Purânas (<i>poo-rah’năz</i>),
of more recent birth, believed to have been revealed
from heaven like the Vedas, present in verse the mythology
of India and the history of its legendary age.</p>

<p><b>Religion of the Veda.</b>—The Supreme Being first acknowledged
by the Aryans was gradually lost sight of, and a worship
of Nature arose. In the 1,028 hymns of the Rig-Veda
(by several hundred authors, and comprising 10,580 verses),
“thrice eleven” gods are invoked as intelligent beings, the
principal of whom are Varuna (<i>vur’oo-nah</i>)—god of waters,
the sun, the moon, the day, fire, the storm (Indra), the dawn,
and the earth; and to “the three and thirty,” offerings were
made of cakes, wine, and grain. They were immortal; clothed
with power to answer prayer, and punish those who offended
them. But as each great god is recognized as supreme in
different hymns, it is with good reason thought that, under
various names, one omnipotent Being is worshipped, called in
the Veda “God above all gods,” “that One alone who has upheld
the spheres.” “Wise poets,” says the Rig-Veda, “make
the Beautiful-winged, though he is one, manifold by words.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>In the following hymn to Varuna is apparent the belief
that evil-doing is hateful to the Almighty, that man is by
nature prone to sin, and that God stands ready to exercise
forgiveness.</p>


<p class="center">HYMN TO VARUNA.</p>

<p>(We have given Max Müller’s literal translation a dress of verse, the
better to bring out the effect of the refrain.)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Varuna, let me not yet enter the house of clay:</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Mercy, Almighty one, thy mercy I pray!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, like a cloud the sport of winds, I trembling go astray—</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Mercy, Almighty one, thy mercy I pray!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through want of strength, thou strong bright God, I’ve wandered from the way:</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Mercy, Almighty one, thy mercy I pray!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thirst comes upon the worshipper, though round the waters play:</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Mercy, Almighty one, thy mercy I pray!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When we do wrong through thoughtlessness, thy hand of vengeance stay:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Transgressors of thy righteous law, thy mercy, God, we pray!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But of all the conceptions of the Vedic writers, that of the
Dawn Goddess was the most poetical. Watching for the
first flush in the eastern sky, her ancient worshippers, with
their hands devoutly placed upon their foreheads, opened
their hearts in strains of praise to the gloom-dispelling
Dawn, the golden-hued Daughter of Heaven, leading on the
sun with her modest smile, “like a radiant bride adorned by
her mother for the bridegroom.”</p>

<p>The sun is represented as a glorious prince, hastening after
the Dawn-maiden and trying to discover her by a tiny slipper
which she has dropped, and which is too small for another to
wear; but the prince never overtakes the flying maid. This
beautiful myth is the origin of the tale of Cinderella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The Veda contains no allusions to those corrupt practices
which afterward became the distinguishing marks of Brahmanism.
At this early period there was no belief in the
transmigration of the souls of men into inferior animals; on
the contrary, the Vedic Aryans looked for “excellent treasures
in the sky.” To caste, they were also strangers; idols
were unknown; and suttee, the burning of the widow at
her husband’s funeral, was an unheard-of barbarity.</p>


<p><b>Social Life of the Vedic People.</b>—The hymns of the Rig-Veda
picture the manners and customs of an intellectual
people, far advanced in the arts. Princely palaces are described,
fortified cities, monarchs possessed of fabulous riches,
ladies elegantly attired. There were poor as well as rich,
workers in the various handicrafts; shipbuilding was practised,
and naval expeditions were undertaken. Even at this
remote day literary meetings were held.</p>

<p>Nor were the crimes and vices of later times unknown.
Liars are denounced; thieves, robbers, and intoxicating drinks,
are mentioned; while in one hymn, a gambler laments his
ruin by “the tumbling dice,” and warns others not to play,
but rather to practise husbandry. (On the lessons of the Veda,
<i>see Max Müller’s “India: What can It Teach Us?” p. 141</i>.)</p>

<p>The following extract from one of the secular hymns which
are interspersed with those of a religious character, shows
some knowledge of human nature:—</p>

<h4>LAW-BOOKS OF THE HINDOOS.</h4>


<p><b>Laws of Manu.</b>—Of the many Indian treatises on the moral
law still extant, the most important is the Institutes of Manu
(<i>mun’oo</i>). Early texts transmit the idea of this venerable lawgiver,
sprung from Brahma in the Vedic period. That the
code now bearing his name embodies the precepts of so ancient
a sage, is doubtful. The laws are written in verse. Four
distinct castes are recognized, ascending through the successive
grades of laborers, farmers, warriors, and princes, to the
highest, which consisted of the priests of Brahma, “the soul
of the universe, whom eye, tongue, mind, cannot reach,” from
whose substance all men proceed and to whom all must return
through various states of existence. The childlike religion
of the Veda has disappeared.</p>

<p>The word <i>brahma</i> often occurs in the Vedas with the signification
of worship, or hymn, the vehicle of worship. In the
later Vedic poems it came to mean the universal but impersonal
spiritual principle, all-pervading and self-existent. In
Manu’s Ordinances, Brahma is endowed with personality, and
a definite place is assigned him in the national religious system,
as the creative spirit who made the universe before undiscerned
discernible in the beginning. He, as the Creator,
is united with the three-eyed thousand-named Siva (<i>se’vah</i>)
the Destroyer, and Vishnu the Preserver, in the Hindoo triad.
Vishnu was the first-begotten of Brahma, a benevolent being
who, to overcome the malignant agents of evil, submitted to
various embodiments in human or animal form, known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
<i>Av’atars</i>. Nine avatars, which the Hindoos believed to have
taken place, were favorite themes of Sanscrit poetry; the
tenth, still future, would result in the overthrow of the present
state of things and the ushering in of a new and better era.
(<i>Read Hopkins’s “The Ordinances of Manu.”</i>)</p>

<p><b>Moral Precepts.</b>—The Institutes of Manu regulated the
moral and social life of the people, prescribing certain rules
for the government of society and the punishment of crimes.
Purity of life was enjoined on all. One of the chief duties was
to honor father and mother—the mother a thousand times the
most—and the Brahman more than either. Widows are forbidden
to remarry, and the duties of a wife are thus described:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The wife must always be in a cheerful temper, devoting herself
to the good management of the household, taking great care of the
furniture, and keeping down all expenses with a frugal hand. The
husband to whom her father has given her, she must obsequiously
honor while he lives and never neglect him when he dies. The husband
gives bliss continually to his wife here below, and he will give
her happiness in the next world. He must be constantly revered
as a god by a virtuous wife, even if he does not observe approved
usages, or is devoid of good qualities. A faithful wife, who wishes
to attain heaven and dwell there with her husband, must never do
anything unkind toward him, whether he be living or dead.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following was the punishment for killing a cow, an animal
treated with the honors due to a deity:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All day he must wait on a herd of cows, and stand quaffing the
dust raised by their hoofs.</p>

<p>Free from passion, he must stand when they stand, follow when
they move, lie down near them when they lie down.</p>

<p>By thus waiting on a herd for three months, he who has killed
a cow atones for his guilt.”</p>
</div>


<p class="center">OTHER EXTRACTS FROM MANU.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Greatness is not conferred by years nor by gray hairs, by wealth
nor powerful kindred. Whoever has read the Veda, he always is great.</p>

<p>A Brahman beginning or ending a lecture on the Veda must always
pronounce to himself the syllable OM<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; for unless the syllable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
OM precede his learning will slip away from him, and unless it follow
nothing will be long retained.</p>

<p>When one among all the organs sins, by that single failure all
knowledge of God passes away; as the water flows through one hole
in a leathern bottle.</p>

<p>The names of women should be agreeable, soft, clear, captivating
the fancy, auspicious, ending in long vowels, resembling words of
benediction.”</p>
</div>


<h4>EPIC POETRY.</h4>

<p>Indian literature boasts of two grand epic poems—gems that
would shine in the crown of a Homer or a Milton—the Râmâyana
(<i>rah-mah’yă-nă</i>—Adventures of Râma) and the Mahâbhârata
(<i>mă-hah’bah’ră-tă</i>—Great War of Bhârata), “the
Iliad and Odyssey of Sanscrit poetry.” The date of these
epics is uncertain. Both contain ancient Vedic traditions,
but mingled with these is much that is more recent. It is
probable that the old songs and stories were current among
the people ages before they were arrayed in their present
dress by later poets, who gave them a different religious coloring
to suit the Brahmanical doctrines. Their language is an
improvement on that of the Veda in polish and softness; improvement
would naturally result from oral repetition. (<i>See
Monier Williams’s “Indian Wisdom.”</i>)</p>


<p><b>The Râmâyana</b>, by the poet Vâlmiki (<i>vahl’me-ke</i>), relates the
achievements of Râma (the name assumed by Vishnu in his
seventh avatar, or incarnation), who descended to earth that
he might destroy a demon-prince in Ceylon. Râma becomes
the first-born of the monarch of Oude and heir-apparent to the
throne, marries a lovely princess, Sîtâ (<i>se’tah</i>), whose hand
others had vainly sought, and daily increases in popularity.
But Râma’s mother was not the only queen; a younger and
more beautiful rival prevails on the old king to appoint her
son his successor instead of Râma, and to banish the latter
for fourteen years.</p>

<p>Loyal to his father, though he might have seized the crown
by force, as his mother in her first disappointment bade him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
do, Râma set out for the wilderness, accompanied by his
bride, who refused to remain behind in the luxurious capital.
Soon after his father died of grief; whereupon the younger
brother rejected the crown, and, seeking the exile in the jungle,
saluted him as king. Râma, however, declined the honor,
and, proceeding to fulfil his mission, slew the demon and conquered
Ceylon. Then with his faithful wife he returned to
Oude, to reign jointly with his brother and usher in a golden
age.</p>

<p>The Râmâyana, in this fiction, is supposed to refer to the
conquest of southern India and Ceylon by the Aryans. It so
delighted the Hindoos that it was said, “He who sings and
hears this epic continually has attained to the highest enjoyment,
and will finally be equal to the gods.”</p>


<p class="center">FROM THE RÂMÂYANA.</p>

<p>Sîtâ, informed by her husband of his banishment, thus tenderly
pleads to be the companion of his exile:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will not be a charge to thee: the wood will give me roots,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spring will yield me water, and the branch provide me fruits.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In hermit’s humble mantle clad, and guarded by my lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I long to wander through the wood, the rivulet to ford,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To climb the rock, and gaze upon the lake that looks so cool;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oh! the pleasant bathing in the clear and shaded pool,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With waters freshly running from the sweet perennial springs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All lovely with the lotuses and wild swans’ silver wings.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would not live in heaven itself, and thou, my love, away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A thousand years with thee, my love, would seem one blissful day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then take me with thee to the wood, nor leave me here alone:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will not be a burthen sore to thee, mine own! mine own!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Râma seeks to dissuade her:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Where serpents with their venomed fangs and poisonous scorpions crawl;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There thro’ the day the tiger roams, the panther and the boar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thro’ the night the caverned hills echo the lion’s roar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There many a river deep and wide will bar thine onward way,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where fearful crocodiles amid the foaming waters play.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The forest paths, my Sîtâ dear, are rough and hard to pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tangled with knotted creeping plants, and thorns, and matted grass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er many a league the wild woods stretch, and savage beasts abound;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No fruit or flower may there be seen, and water scarce is found;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No bed is there to rest the limbs, but stretched upon a heap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fallen leaves and gathered grass the homeless wretch must sleep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No, such a life is not for thee; cast thou the thought away;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Though far away from thee I go, and thou remainest here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still shalt thou live within the heart to which thou art so dear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet Sîtâ still refuses to be parted from her husband, and
with tearful eyes exclaims:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And death to me were sweeter far, with thine arms round me thrown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than life in thy father’s palaces, in safety, but alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wife’s eternal duty is, as holy priests declare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To follow where her husband goes, his weal and woe to share;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And for the true and loving wife remains the endless bliss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sharing all this life with him, and the life that follows this.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, Râma being still inexorable, Sîtâ bursts forth in anger,
upbraids him for his cruelty in deserting her, and finally, overcome
by emotion, falls weeping at his feet. Then Râma
raises her in his arms, and pours these soothing accents in
her ear:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! what is heaven without thee, love? With thee I’ll live and die;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never will Râma stoop to fear, though Brahma’s self come nigh.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obedience to my father’s will now sends me to the wood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For paramount of duties this is counted by the good.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only to try thy mind, my love, thy prayer I first denied:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I never dreamed that aught could harm the lady by my side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But yet I feared to suffer thee, so delicate and fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The troubles of a forest life and all its woes to share.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, as the glory of his life the saint can ne’er resign,</div>

<p><b>The Mahâbhârata</b> is a vast collection of miscellaneous
poetry, attributed to Vyâsa (<i>ve-ah’să</i>), “the arranger,” containing
over 200,000 lines, and relating the history of a struggle
between two branches of an ancient royal family. Jealousy
led to the separation of the rival parties, one of which, the
Pândavas (<i>pahn’dă-văz</i>), cleared the jungle and founded the
city of Delhi (<i>del’le</i>). But their enemies, the Kurus (<i>Koo’rooz</i>),
resolving to dispossess them, challenged the Pândavas to a
gambling match; the latter accepted, but were cheated out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
of all their possessions by the use of loaded dice, and driven
into the wilderness. A savage war ensued, resulting in the
triumph of the Pândavas, and their elevation over the neighboring
rajahs. (<i>See Arnold’s “Indian Idylls.”</i>)</p>

<p>The great Hindoo epics are both enlivened by charming
episodes. The most beautiful of those interwoven in the
Mahâbhârata are called “the Five Precious Gems.” Of
these, the magnificent philosophical poem entitled <span class="smcap">The Divine
Song</span> withdraws the reader for a while from the tumult of
war, and introduces him to a profound theological dialogue
between a disguised god and one of the principal combatants.
It inculcates the existence of one Immutable, Eternal Being,
and teems with grand thoughts not unlike those we should
expect from a Christian teacher. The immortality of the
soul is thus sublimely set forth by the deity, on the eve of a
decisive battle, for the purpose of removing the scruples of
the chief, while the latter humanely hesitates to precipitate
the conflict in view of the slaughter that would ensue:—</p>

<p>But of all the episodes, that of Nala (<i>nul’ă</i>) and Damayanti
is unsurpassed for pathos and tenderness of sentiment. King
Nala, enamored of the “softly-smiling” Damayanti, “pearl
among women,” finds his love returned, and is accepted by
her in preference to many other princes and even four of the
gods. A jealous demon, however, possesses him, and causes
him to lose at play everything except his bride, whom he cannot
be prevailed upon to stake. Yet at last, in his madness,
he deserts her in the forest, and Damayanti, after many
strange adventures, reaches her father’s court in safety.
There she adopts the device of inviting suitors a second time
to propose for her hand, in the hope of bringing her lost husband
to her side if he should hear that there was danger of
his losing her forever.</p>

<p>Nala, meanwhile, disguised as a charioteer, had entered
the service of another king, who now sets forth to offer himself
to the beauteous princess, driven by her husband. When
they arrive Damayanti penetrates the disguise of the charioteer,
and to prove the correctness of her suspicions, puts
him to the severest test. She contrives to have his children
brought before him. The father’s heart is touched at once;
he clasps them in his arms, and bursts into tears.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Soon as he young Indrasena and her little brother saw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up he sprang, his arms wound round them, to his bosom folding both.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he gazed upon the children, like the children of the gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All his heart o’erflowed with pity, and unwilling tears brake forth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not wishing, however, to reveal himself to a wife whom he
thought false, he added by way of apology for his conduct,</p>

  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>
<p>Finally Nala makes himself known to Damayanti, and, convinced

<p>Such are the Sanscrit epics and their episodes. They are
still recited in the temples of India to vast throngs of appreciative
listeners; the reading of the Mahâbhârata is said to
occupy from three to six months. (On the epics, <i>consult

<h4>LYRIC AND DIDACTIC POETRY.</h4>


<p><b>Kâlidâsa.</b>—In lyric poetry, embracing idyls and amatory
pieces, Sanscrit is no less rich than in epic, whether quantity
or quality be considered. Foremost in this department is
Kâlidâsa (<i>kah’le-dah’să</i>), about whose life, and even his exact
period, nothing is certainly known, but whose works have
crowned him with immortality. He is the author of many
charming verses; and his poem, “the Seasons,” which draws
fascinating pictures of the luxuriant landscapes of India, displaying
on every page the poet’s ardent love for the beauties
of nature, has the honor of being the first book ever printed
in Sanscrit.</p>

<p>Surpassing “the Seasons” in dignity and elegance, “the
Cloud Messenger,” by the same author, contains some fine
flights of fancy. It tells how an inferior god, banished for
twelve months to a sacred forest and thus separated from a
wife whom he fondly loves, commits to a passing cloud a message
for his goddess. He directs its imaginary journey through
the sky, over forests and hills, to the city of the gods. There
it will easily distinguish his wife, whom he paints to the cloud
in glowing colors as the “first, best work of the Creator’s
hand,” mourning over their separation.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Their shrinking petals from the withering cold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I view her now! Long weeping swells her eyes,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sad on her hand her pallid cheek declines,</div>

<p class="pnind">and finally he charges his messenger to console her afflicted
heart with assurances of his unabated love, and to hasten back
with tidings that may relieve his soul of its anxiety. The cloud
obeys; but meanwhile the supreme deity learns of the message,
repents of his severity, restores the exile to his wife, and
blesses the pair with ceaseless joy.</p>

<p>Kâlidâsa also wrote three epics of a romantic character,
one of them on the adventures of Nala and his devoted Damayanti.
Well does he merit the title conferred on him by
his admiring countrymen,—“the Bridegroom of Poesy.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p><b>Jayadeva</b> (<i>jī-ă-dā’vă</i>), a poet probably of more recent times,
if not equal to Kâlidâsa, yet has given us in Gîtagovinda one
of the most enchanting idyls ever written. In this Song of
the Shepherd Govinda, the form assumed by the god Krishna,
are set forth in voluptuous colors the adventures of the deity
and nine shepherdesses, his beautiful attendants. The whole
is supposed to be a mystical allegory.</p>

<p>The high estimation in which Jayadeva is held, may be inferred
from the following eulogy by an Oriental critic: “Whatever
is delightful in the modes of music, whatever is exquisite
in the sweet art of love, whatever is graceful in the strains of
poetry—all that let the happy and wise learn from the songs
of Jayadeva.” (<i>See Arnold’s “Indian Poetry,” p. 86.</i>)</p>

<h4>THE DRAMA.</h4>

<p><b>The Sanscrit Shakespeare.</b>—Not the least valuable of Sanscrit
treasures is its dramatic poetry. Here, as in lyric verse,
Kâlidâsa stands prëeminent, the Shakespeare of India. His
title to this distinction rests mainly on his drama of Sakoon’talâ,
or the Lost Ring, which portrays the simple life and unsophisticated
manners of his countrymen with all his characteristic
tenderness of expression and rich imagination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plot of Sakoontalâ.</span>—In early summer—the fitting season,
sacred as it was to the god of love—the play of Sakoontalâ was
wont to be acted in ancient India. The heroine, whose name
the drama bears, was the daughter of a nymph, and dwelt at a
hermitage in the jungle. Led to her retreat by chance in his
pursuit of a deer, a neighboring rajah espies the “slender-waisted”
forest maid, with two lovely companions, watering
the shrubbery. Concealing himself among the trees, he plays
eaves-dropper, and as he watches the trio he cannot restrain
his admiration; “the woodland plants,” he cries, “outshine
the garden flowers.” His heart is lost forthwith. Ordering
his camp to be pitched near by, he wooes and finally weds
Sakoontalâ, with the assurance that she shall “reign without
a rival in his heart.” Then leaving his bride a marriage-ring,
engraved with his name, as a token of their union, the rajah
goes back to his palace, promising that Sakoontalâ shall soon
share his throne.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Repeat each day one letter of the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Engraven on this gem; ere thou hast reckoned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tale of syllables, my minister</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall come to lead thee to thy husband’s palace.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not long after his departure, a sage whose anger she has
incurred pronounces a curse upon the pair,—“that he of whom
she thought should think of her no more,” should even forget
her image, and that the spell should cease only at sight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
marriage-ring. This token of remembrance, however, was secured
on her finger; and at length Sakoontalâ, re-assured by
a favorable omen, leaves the sorrowing companions of her girlhood,
and the venerable hermit, her reputed father, to seek her
husband in his capital.</p>

<p>Arrived in safety, she gains access to the royal presence;
but the king, laboring under the curse, fails to recognize her.
Sakoontalâ is unveiled, and stands before him in all her beauty—a
beauty that stirs him to exclaim:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What charms are here revealed before mine eyes!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Truly no blemish mars the symmetry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that fair form; yet can I ne’er believe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is my wedded wife; and like a bee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That circles round the flower whose nectared cup</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teems with the dew of morning, I must pause</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere eagerly I taste the proffered sweetness.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Sakoontalâ seeks her ring, but alas! it is not on her
finger; she must have dropped it in the Ganges. In the midst
of her confusion a nymph appears, and carries her off to a sacred
retreat, where she gives birth to a son.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a fish is caught, in which is found the fatal ring,
stamped with the rajah’s name. It is restored to its owner,
and at once the recollection of his long-forgotten Sakoontalâ
flashes upon his mind. Overwhelmed with poignant regret
for her loss, he abandons himself to melancholy for a time,
calling on her beloved name, or trying to beguile his grief by
tracing with his pencil her features now but too well remembered.
At length ambition and piety unite to wake him from
his lethargy. He embarks in a campaign against the giants,
enemies of the gods; is victorious; and finds the consummation
of happiness at last in a union with his long-lost wife, and
with his son, whose name, Bhârata, becomes the most distinguished
in the mythology of India.</p>

<p>English readers are enabled to enjoy the beauties of Sakoontalâ
through the metrical version of Prof. Williams.</p>

<p>From the author of this drama we have two other pieces
worthy of his fame, “the Hero and the Nymph” and a popular
comedy. His era was the golden age of the Hindoo
theatre.</p>

<p>Other noted plays, a few out of many, are “the Toy Cart,”
a domestic drama with a public underplot; “the Signet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the Minister,” which had a political bearing; “the Stolen
Marriage;” and an allegorical play, “the Moonrise of Science.”</p>


<p><b>The Hindoo Drama</b>, the invention of which was ascribed to
an ancient sage inspired by Brahma himself, consisted at
first of music, dancing, and pantomime. An outcome of the
prevailing mythology, it was made a feature of the Indian
festivals, and from very early rude beginnings of which we
have no remains gradually progressed to the perfection with
which Kâlidâsa invested it. Unfolding the inner life of the
people and illustrating their peculiar institutions, it is at once
interesting and valuable, original, and in its delineations of
character strikingly true to nature. Love is its principal
subject; and, what is markedly characteristic, its denouements
are always happy. Tragedy is foreign to the Hindoo
stage.</p>

<p>The Indian plays began and closed with a benediction or
prayer; in many cases there was a preliminary account of
the author, or a colloquy between the manager and one of
the actors, leading the way to the play itself. The heroes
were generally kings or deities. As foils to these, it was
usual to introduce mountebanks or buffoons, and as such
Brahmans were made to figure. The Hindoo dramatists did
not hesitate to set forth their priests in a ridiculous light;
a remarkable fact, when we remember that the drama in India
was a semi-religious institution, and that the managers
of companies were usually themselves Brahmans. The playwright
who in Greece should have taken such liberties with
his religious superiors would have run the risk of being
driven from the stage, if indeed he were not more seriously
handled by an indignant audience.</p>

<p>The consistency observed in managing the dialogue is
noteworthy. The parts spoken by divinities and heroes,
rulers and priests, are always in ancient Sanscrit; while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
inferior personages and the female characters use the later
and more familiar dialect. Want of acquaintance with the
sacred language, which thus formed the staple of the classical
plays, no doubt prevented the common people from fully
understanding and enjoying dramatic representations; and
hence the latter never attained that popularity which they
had in other countries. They were the entertainment of the
cultured class rather than the masses.</p>

<p>Another curious feature of the Hindoo drama was the
absence of scenery, the plays being mostly represented in
the open air, the courts of palaces, etc. The great advantage
which the modern performer derives from fine scenic
effects was entirely wanting. Changes of scene could be indicated
only in the text, by minute descriptions of the new
locality, thrown into the mouths of the speakers and left for
the audience to fill out and remember. No shifting of scenes,
for instance, as with us, would denote the entrance of one of
the characters from out-doors into a drawing-room; but the
personage entering, either in a soliloquy or in colloquy with
some other, would immediately call attention to every little
point—the threshold, the floor, the ceiling, the walls, the
doors, the windows, the furniture—and the glowing fancy of
his hearers would at once picture the scene as vividly as if
it stood before them in reality.</p>

<p>The proprieties were strictly observed. To represent a
death scene would have been intolerable; nor only so, but
in the earlier and purer days no dramatist would introduce
before his audience a scene of violence, eating, sleeping, or
the performance of the marriage ceremony. A charming love-scene
in the Sakoontalâ breaks off just at the critical moment
when the hero and heroine are about to interchange a token
of affection; yet the embrace does not appear always to have
been repugnant to the Hindoo ideas of delicacy.</p>

<p>As to the date of the dramas that have been mentioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
they are supposed to have been written during the first ten
centuries of the Christian Era; but here, as in the case of the
epics and lyrics, we are left to conjecture. Could we know
more certainly what times they reflect, our pleasure in perusing
them would be complete.</p>


<h4>TALES AND FABLES.</h4>

<p>India has long enjoyed the reputation, and not without
reason, of having been the favorite home of fairy-tale and
fable. From her storehouse of fictions, many waifs have
crept into the literatures of both Europe and Asia, and striking
the popular taste have attained wide currency. Tongues
have changed, dynasties have fallen; but these stories by unknown
hands still live in the nursery, influencing the pliant
minds of the children of to-day as they have done those of
the last twenty centuries.</p>

<p>The Sanscrit has two great collections of fables,—the
Pankatantra, <i>Five Stories</i> (more properly <i>Five Sections</i>); and
the Hitopadesa, <i>Friendly Advice</i>, a charming compilation from
the former. The Hitopadesa, translated into many languages,
has almost rivalled in circulation the Bible itself. In the following
fable, selected from “the Friendly Advice,” will be
seen the germ of La Fontaine’s charming imitation, “the
Milkmaid and the Pitcher of Milk;” both point the same
moral as our own cautionary proverb, “Don’t count your
chickens before they are hatched.”</p>


<p class="center">THE STUPID BRAHMAN.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the town of Devikotta there lived a Brahman of the name of
Devasarman. At the feast of the great equinox he received a plateful
of rice. He took it, went into a potter’s shop, which was full of
crockery, and, overcome by the heat, he lay down in a corner and began
to doze. In order to protect his plate of rice, he kept a stick in
his hand; and he began to think: ‘Now if I sell this plate of rice,
I shall receive ten cowries. I shall then, on the spot, buy pots and
plates, and after having increased my capital again and again I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
buy and sell betel nuts and dresses till I grow enormously rich. Then
I shall marry four wives, and the youngest and prettiest of the four
I shall make a great pet of. Then the other wives will be so angry
and begin to quarrel. But I shall be in a great rage, and take a stick,
and give them a good flogging.’</p>

<p>While he said this, suiting the action to the thought, he laid about
him with his stick; the plate of rice was smashed to pieces, and
many of the pots in the shop were broken. The potter, hearing the
noise, ran in; and when he saw his pots broken, gave the Brahman
a good scolding and drove him out of the shop.</p>

<p>Therefore I say, ‘He who rejoices over plans for the future will
come to grief, like the Brahman who broke the pots.’”—<span class="smcap">Max Müller.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Of the numerous collections of tales and romances, the best
known is “the Ocean of the Rivers of Narratives,” the original
of that more familiar compilation, the Arabian Nights.</p>


<h4>HISTORY, GRAMMAR, ETC.</h4>

<p>Sanscrit is also worthily represented in other departments
of literature; on the fine arts we have nothing worthy of
notice, but science has not been neglected, while historical,
grammatical, and philosophical works, complete the category
of its productions. Its chronicles, however, obscured as they
are by myths without number, are comparatively valueless;
but one deserves the name of history, the Chronicle of Cashmere,
or the Stream of the Kings, extending from the fabulous
ages to the reign of Akbar, who reduced that province
in the 16th century.</p>

<p>But in grammar we must certainly award to Sanscrit the
very first place. Commentaries on the constructions of the
Veda, dating perhaps from 750 B.C., embody the earliest attempts
at grammatical and critical investigation with which
we are acquainted; and in the digest of Pânini (<i>pah’ne-ne</i>)
(500 B.C.?) we have the first systematic grammar that the
world ever produced—a book remarkable for its completeness,
declared by Max Müller to be “the perfection of an empirical
analysis of language, unsurpassed—nay, even unapproached,
by anything in the grammatical literature of other nations.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>In connection with the literature of India, we may also mention
inscriptions on monuments, in temples and grottoes, and
on plates of marble and copper. These are worthy of study
mainly in view of the historical information they may afford.</p>

<p>Such is a history, in outline, of the ancient Sanscrit, of
which Prof. Müller has written: “The study of it will open
before you large layers of literature as yet almost unknown
and unexplored, and allow you an insight into strata of
thought rich in lessons that appeal to the deepest sympathies
of the human heart.”</p>

<h4>BUDDHIST LITERATURE.</h4>

<p>About 500 B.C., a new and purer religion was preached in
India by a monk of royal birth, afterward called Buddha (<i>the
Enlightened</i>). It met with a hearty reception from the people,
for it taught men to live in charity with their neighbors,
to reverence their parents, to practise truth and morality;
above all, it overthrew the institution of caste, and abolished
the foolish system of Brahman sacrifices. The riches and
fleeting pleasures of this world, Buddha proclaimed unworthy
of pursuit, representing life itself as a burden, and promising
his followers a paradise of eternal rest<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> beyond the grave.
No wonder that thousands declared in favor of the new faith,
which during a struggle of many centuries disputed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Brahmanism for the supremacy of India. Pushing out to the
northeast, it made its way into Thibet, China, and Japan; and
at the present day has more followers than any other religious
system, their number being estimated at 450,000,000. (<i>Consult
Hardy’s “Manual of Buddhism.”</i>)</p>

<p>The sacred books of the Buddhists are called the Tripitaka
(<i>three baskets</i>); one is metaphysical, another disciplinary, and
the third contains the discourses of Buddha. They are written
in a dialect of Sanscrit, and are made up of 600,000 stanzas,
containing five times as much matter as our Bible. (<i>See Monier
Williams’s “Buddhism in its Contrast with Christianity.”</i>)</p>


<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM THE BUDDHIST SCRIPTURES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The succoring of mother and father, the cherishing of child and
wife, and the following of a lawful calling,—this is the greatest
blessing.</p>

<p>The giving of alms, the abstaining from sins, the eschewing of intoxicating
drink, diligence in good deeds, reverence and humility,
contentment and gratitude,—this is the greatest blessing.</p>

<p>He who lives for pleasure only, his senses uncontrolled, idle and
weak, the tempter will certainly overcome him as the wind throws
down a weak tree.</p>

<p>Like a beautiful flower, full of color but without scent, are the fine
but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.</p>

<p>As the bee collects nectar, and departs without injuring the flower,
or its color and scent, so let the sage dwell on earth.</p>

<p>Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, ‘It will not
come near unto me.’ Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot
is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gathers it little by
little.</p>

<p>Let us live happily then, though we call nothing our own; not
hating those who hate us, free from greed among the greedy. We
shall then be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness.”</p>

<p class="center">NOTES ON HINDOO LITERATURE, ETC.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The literature of India incalculably vast, and its individual works voluminous.
The Mahâbhârata six times as long as the Iliad, Odyssey, and Æneid united;
the Râmâyana half this size. The eighteen Purânas contain 1,600,000 lines.
The library of one of the kings said to have numbered so many books that a
hundred Brahmans were employed in taking care of it, and a thousand dromedaries
were required to convey it from place to place; twenty years were con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>sumed
in condensing its contents, by the royal command, into an encyclopædia
of 12,000 volumes. Sir William Jones computed that the longest life would not
suffice for the perusal of all the Sanscrit writings.—First century B.C. believed
to have been an Augustan age of Indian literature.</p>

<p>Writing apparently unknown to the ancient Hindoos before the time of Pânini.
No mention anywhere made, in the early works, of writing materials, pen
or brush, paper, bark, or skin. The Vedic hymns sung or repeated probably for
a thousand years before they were committed to writing. The use of the alphabet
long regarded as impious. First letters appear in Buddhist inscriptions of
the 3d century B.C. Later Indian manuscripts, beautifully inscribed on palm
leaves. The letters of the Sanscrit alphabet thought to be the oldest forms of
our Arabic figures, which came originally from India, as did also our decimal
system.</p>

<p>Chess one of the earliest inventions of the Hindoos—called chess (<i>king</i>) from
the principal piece. The Brahman inventor, so the story goes, asked of the
reigning emperor as his reward, a single grain of wheat for the first square of the
chess-board, two for the second, four for the third, and so on to the sixty-fourth;
apparently a modest price, but one that it would have taken years to pay with
the wheat crop of the whole world. Elephants, horses, foot-soldiers, and chariots,
the original chess-men. From India, the game found its way into China,
Japan, and Persia, and finally into Europe.—Throwing dice, also, a favorite pastime;
the “Game of Four Crowns,” with playing-cards, early known to the
Hindoos.</p>

<small><i>PERSIAN LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Avesta.</b>—Sprung from the same ancient Aryan tongue as
the Sanscrit of India, and distinguished by the same richness
of inflection, is Avesta, the earliest language of Persia, still
preserved to us in the Persian Scriptures known as <i>the</i> Avesta.
The Veda and the Avesta have been described as “two rivers
flowing from one fountain-head;” and beyond a doubt the
Vedic Aryans and the Avesta-speaking Persians were originally
one community, conversing in a common tongue.</p>

<p>The Avesta was first made known to Europeans by a French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
orientalist; Anquetil Duperron (<i>on<sup>g</sup>k-teel’ deu-pa-ron<sup>g</sup>’</i>), who
went to India for the express purpose of discovering the sacred
books of the Parsees. With great difficulty he at length
possessed himself of the much-desired Avesta manuscripts,
and in 1771, after long and patient effort, he gave his countrymen
men the first translation of the Avesta into a European
tongue. The language has since been carefully studied, and
in our own day has at last been mastered. Time wrought
many changes in it; the Persian of Xerxes’ reign differed
much more from the Avesta of antiquity than our present
language does from the English of Chaucer. Further modifications
and the introduction of Arabic elements have made
modern Persian still more unlike the ancient vernacular.</p>

<p>The sacred writings of Persia just referred to are among
the oldest and most important in the whole range of Indo-European
literature. They contain the doctrines of Zoroaster,
or Zarathushtra, the Bactrian sage who reformed the religious
system of his country. (<i>See Jackson’s Avesta Series, Part I.</i>)</p>


<p><b>Zoroaster</b> is believed to have flourished about 1400 B.C.
Nothing is known of his life or history. Yet, through more
than thirty centuries his influence has been felt; and to-day,
though they have dwindled to perhaps 150,000 souls, his followers
constitute a thrifty and intelligent population in India
and Persia. These Parsees, or Fire-worshippers (called by
the Mohammedans <i>Guebres</i>, or infidels), still burn the eternal
fire, kindled as they believe from heaven, not for idolatrous
worship, but as an emblem of Ormazd, the Almighty source
of light. They are descendants of those Zoroastrians whom
Darius and Xerxes launched against Europe in the mightiest
armies ever raised by man, threatening to plant their purer
faith amid the ruined shrines of Greece. (<i>Read Haug’s “Essays
on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Religion of the Parsis.”</i>)</p>

<p>At a later date, when the Caliph Omar converted Persia to
Mohammedanism with the sword (641 A.D.), their forefathers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
clung to the ancient faith, and found an asylum across the
Indus or in the deserts of their native land.</p>


<p><b>The Avesta</b> (<i>sacred text</i>) contains the only existing monuments
of a once extensive literature. It is divided into distinct
parts, made up of separate pieces and fragments, which,
repeated orally from generation to generation, were probably
collected and reduced to writing in their present form many
centuries after the period of Zoroaster. The compositions in
question are chiefly professed revelations and instructions to
mankind, confessions, prayers to the Supreme Being and various
inferior deities, and metrical hymns (<i>Gâthâs</i>), simple
and some of them so grand as to be deemed the productions
of Zoroaster himself.</p>

<p>Zoroaster is represented in the Avesta as conversing with
Ormazd, who, in answer to the inquiries of the sage, reveals
his will, and prescribes the moral and ceremonial law. Thus,
in the following passage, Zoroaster questions Ormazd:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“O Ormazd (Ahura Mazda), most holy spirit, creator of existent
worlds, righteous One! What, O Ormazd, was the Word (more correctly,
Ahuna Vairya, the name of a sacred verse) which you pronounced
for me before the heaven, before the water, before the cow,
before the tree, before the fire, before the righteous man, before the
demons and noxious creatures?”</p>

<p>Then Ormazd replies: “I will tell thee, most holy Zoroaster, what
was the Creative Word I pronounced for thee before the heaven, before
the water, before the cow, before the tree, before the fire, before
the righteous man, before the demons and noxious creatures, before
all the universe. Such is the whole of the Creative Word, which,
even when unpronounced and unrecited, outweighs a thousand
breathed prayers, which are not pronounced, nor recited, nor sung.
And he who in this world, O most holy Zoroaster, remembers the
whole of the Creative Word, or utters it, or sings it, I will lead his
soul thrice across the bridge of the better world, to the better existence,
to the better truth, to the better days. I pronounced this
Speech which contains the Word and its working, before the creation
of this heaven, and before the creation of the earth.</p>

<p>“He is a holy man,” says Ormazd elsewhere, “who constructs upon
the earth a habitation in which he maintains fire, cattle, his wife, his
children, and flocks and herds. He who makes the earth produce
grain, who cultivates the fruits of the fields, he maintains purity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
he promotes the law of Ormazd as much as if he offered a hundred
sacrifices.”</p>
</div>


<p><b>Avesta Philosophy.</b>—The Avesta seems to recognize one
eternal Supreme Being, infinite and omnipotent. This was
Ormazd (<i>Spiritual Wise One</i>), whom Zoroaster invokes as the
source of light and purity, “true, lucid, shining,” all-perfect,
all-powerful, all-beautiful, all-wise.” Opposed to Ormazd was
a principle of darkness and evil, called Ah’riman (Angra
Mainyu, <i>Sinful-minded</i>). The theory of evolution finds no
support in the Avesta, which contains an account of the creation
of the universe strikingly like that of Moses. Traditions
of the fall of man through the falsehood of Ahriman, and of a
universal deluge, are also handed down. (On the Avesta, <i>see
Müller’s “Sacred Books of the East,” vols. iv., xxiii., xxxi.</i>)</p>

<p>Zoroaster’s mission was to exhort men to follow the right
and forsake the wrong. “Choose one of these two spirits,
the Good or the Evil,” he said; “you cannot serve both.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of these two Spirits, the Wicked One chose to do evil; the Holy
Spirit, whose garment is the immovable sky, chose what is right, as
they also do who faithfully please Ormazd by good works.</p>

<p>“And between these two Spirits, the demons chose not aright.
Madness came upon them, so that they chose the Worst Mind, and
they went over to the side of wrath to destroy the life of mankind.</p>

<p>“Now then, may we be those who make this life perfect; and may
Ormazd and Asha (Righteousness) grant their aid, that he whose
faith is altered may become of believing heart.</p>

<p>“For at the final reckoning, the blow of annihilation will come
upon falsehood; but they who enjoy a good report will see their
hopes fulfilled in the blessed abode of the Good Mind.</p>

<p>“If, O men, ye mark these doctrines which Mazda instituted for
your well-being, and that torment will come to the wicked and blessing
to the righteous, through these will be your salvation.”—<i>Geldner.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Like Buddha, the Persian reformer raised his voice against
the priesthood, and the corruptions which had crept into the
national religion. Devil-worship, which had come into vogue
as a means of averting the evil supposed to be wrought by
wicked spirits, he specially denounced, recognizing in sin the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
cause of all human sorrow, and urging men to wage uncompromising
warfare with the powers of darkness, relying for aid
on the Good Spirit. “Give offering and praise,” says the
Avesta, “to that Lord who made men greater than all earthly
beings, and through the gift of speech created them to rule
the creatures, <i>as warriors against the evil spirits</i>.” Fire was
invoked as the symbol of Divinity, and the sun as “the eye
of Ormazd;” but idolatry Zoroaster and his disciples abhorred.</p>

<p>Ormazd was the rewarder of the good, the punisher of the
bad. Those who obeyed him, and were “pure in thoughts,
pure in words, pure in actions,” were admitted at death into
<i>Paradise</i>, “the House of the Angels’ Hymns,” where all was
brightness: the wicked were consigned to a region of everlasting
darkness, “the House of the Fiend Deceit.” Of all the
religions of human origin, Zoroaster’s, though not free from
superstition and cumbrous rites, approaches nearest to the
truth. It was gladly accepted by the people, and did much
to elevate them and improve their condition. We have thrown
into verse the following</p>

<p><b>Persian Inscriptions.</b>—In a flower-clad plain of southwest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>ern
Persia, shut in from the outer world by lofty hills, and
now dotted with pleasant villages, once stood the great palace
of Persep’olis, the wonder of the world for its magnificence—which
Alexander, in a fit of drunken fury, reduced to a heap
of ruins with his wanton torch (331 B.C.). Yet, though silent
and deserted, “the piles of fallen Persepolis" speak to us, not
only with their strange sculptures, but also through the inscriptions
carved upon them in cuneiform letters, originally
adorned with gold.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p065" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p065.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">THE ROCK OF BEHISTUN.<br />
MOUNTAIN RECORD OF DARIUS.</div>
</div>

<p>Not far from these ruins is the famous rock of Behistun,
1,700 feet high, and inscribed with the same arrow-headed,
wedge-shaped characters. Some of these, protected from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
weather by a varnish of flint, have been wonderfully preserved
to the present time.</p>

<p>This mountain-record was set up by Darius I. (516-515
B.C.), who, in the shadow of the palace-walls of Persepolis, was
wont to sit upon a throne of gold, canopied by a vine of the
same precious metal bearing clusters of priceless gems. It is
his triumphal tablet, graven with figures of himself and several
conquered princes. It records his victories, asserts his hereditary
right to the throne, and enumerates the provinces of his
vast empire, in nearly a thousand lines of cuneiform characters—in
three different languages, the Persian, Scythian, and
Babylonian—that it might be understood by all his subjects.</p>

<p>Here the Persian monarch announces his dignity, while he
attributes the glory of it all to the God Supreme:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am Darius, the Great King, the King of Kings, the King of
Persia, the King of the dependent provinces, the son of Hystaspes.</p>

<p>By the grace of Ormazd I am King. Ormazd has granted me my
empire. The countries which have fallen into my hands, by the
grace of Ormazd I have become king of them.</p>

<p>Within these countries, whoever was good, him have I cherished
and protected; whoever was evil, him have I utterly destroyed. By
the grace of Ormazd, these countries have obeyed my laws. By the
grace of Ormazd, I hold this empire.”</p>
</div>

<p>Other inscriptions were cut by order of Xerxes, whose royal
name and title they formally declare; but there are none of
any later date. Cuneiform letters were also employed by
other nations, as will be hereafter seen (page 105). Most of
the ancient Persian literature was lost during the struggle with
Alexander the Great, and subsequent wars and convulsions.

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ancient Persian records made on leather; parchment the favorite writing
material, the high price of papyrus preventing its adoption. Bricks seldom used
for inscriptions. A running hand, different from the cuneiform, probably in use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
among the people for ordinary purposes, as every educated person could undoubtedly
write: no trace of this left.</p>

<p>The kings of Persia founders of a library consisting of historical records, state
archives, and royal ordinances. “The house of the rolls" at Babylon is mentioned
in the book of Ezra as being searched, during the reign of Darius, for a
certain volume supposed to contain a decree of Cyrus, providing for the rebuilding
of the Temple at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The old priestly order of Media and Persia, known as Ma’gi; devoted to scientific
studies, in which they attained such eminence that they were believed to
possess supernatural powers—whence our word <i>magic</i>. The “wise men” of the
New Testament by some supposed to be Persian Magi.</p>

<p>The Zoroastrian religion, which was on the wane, restored and maintained in
the third century after Christ by the Sassan’idæ, who measured swords successfully
with the Roman emperors, and extended the power of Persia. The Avesta
translated into Pahlavi, a mixture of Semitic with Iranian elements, in which are
preserved most of the details of the traditions, ceremonies, and customs of the
ancient faith. The combined text and Pahlavi translation known as Avesta-Zend,
or <i>revelation</i> and <i>commentary</i>. (<i>See “Sacred Books of the East,” vol. v.</i>)</p>

<small><i>CHINESE LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Chinese Language.</b>—From the Persian Gâthâs and Vedic
hymns, let us now turn to the prose writings of the Chinese
philosophers, plain, grave, and moral in their tone. The language
in which their tenets have been preserved differs materially
from the musical Sanscrit and its sister Avesta.</p>

<p>Modern Chinese, which has changed but little from the
ancient tongue and is the least developed of all existing languages,
is monosyllabic; i. e. each syllable conveys a complete
idea, all its words are expressed by single separate
sounds. Of these elements, or <i>roots</i>, it contains 450; changes
of emphasis and intonation, accompanied with corresponding
changes in meaning, increase this number to 1,263.</p>

<p>Chinese may be called a language without grammar, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
dispenses with inflection and conjugation, and leaves the relations
of words and their functions as different parts of speech
to be determined by the arrangement. Thus <i>sin</i> means <i>honor</i>,
<i>honorable</i>, <i>honorably</i>, or <i>to be honorable</i>, according to its position
in the sentence. Plurality and gender are generally indicated
by adding roots with a modifying signification. Son
in Chinese is <i>man-child</i>; daughter, <i>woman-child</i>; a mare is
called a <i>mother-horse</i>; people is the word <i>surnames</i> with <i>a
hundred</i> prefixed. This grouping together of roots is carried
to great lengths. Writing materials is expressed by two words
denoting <i>four precious objects</i> (paper, brush, ink, and palette); a
trader is <i>a buying-selling-man</i>; a knife is a <i>sword’s-son</i>; while
difference of opinion is expressed by four words meaning <i>I
east, thou west</i>.</p>

<p><b>Characters used in Writing.</b>—The written characters of
the Chinese were originally outline pictures of visible objects;
specimens are presented below. A crescent (1) stood for the
moon; three peaks (2), for a mountain; (3) is a tortoise, (4) a
fish, (5) a field. Pictographs were frequently combined to
represent a single idea. The notion of song, for instance,
was conveyed by a mouth and a bird (6); that of tears, by
the symbols for eye and water; beauty and goodness, by the
representation of a virgin and an infant.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p068" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p068.jpg" alt="The Pictographs" />
</div>


<p>One or more of these hieroglyphic symbols (<i>determinatives</i>)
enter into the composition of every modern Chinese character—which
has also a phonetic element, like the characters of the
Egyptian (p. 120) and Assyrian (p. 106) systems. The ideographic
element is indispensable: the one sound <i>tschoo</i>, for
example, means ape, whirlpool, island, silk, deep, a wine, a kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
of plant, to enclose, to help, to quarrel, to walk, to answer. It
would be next to impossible to interpret the written symbol
correctly, were not a separate ideogram adopted for each idea.
This necessary device, however, involved the wholesale multiplication
of characters. Over 40,000 are contained in the
fullest dictionaries; but three-fourths of this number are almost
wholly unknown, and only about 5,000 are in common
use.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice how, in the course of ages, the
old hieroglyphics have been transformed into the present
characters. The symbol representing the verb to listen, two
folding-doors and an ear between them <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p069a.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span> is now
written <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p069b.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>. Two shells exactly alike originally stood
for two friends <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p069c.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>; this symbol has been changed
to <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p069d.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>. A mountain is now
<span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p069e.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>; a field <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p069f.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>.
The most complicated modern character is made by fifty-two
strokes of the pen.</p>


<p><b>Antiquity of Chinese Literature.</b>—China prides herself on
her antiquity, and her literature carries us back to the remotest
past. From those early days to the present the chain is
almost unbroken, notwithstanding the irreparable loss sustained
when the ruthless Ching Wang destroyed the great bulk
of Chinese literature (220-205 B.C.). This emperor is noted
for his erection of the Great Wall, and notorious for his contempt
of learning. Thinking to reconcile the masses to his
despotism by keeping them in ignorance, and to deceive posterity
with the belief that he had founded the empire, he ordered
all books, except those on husbandry, divination, and
medicine, to be burned. Any person found with a book in his
possession was condemned to labor four years on the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Wall, and several hundred scholars who resisted the royal decree
were buried alive.</p>

<p>The dynasty of “the book-burner,” however, was not long
after overthrown; and among the succeeding princes was
found a “restorer of literature,” who collected and preserved
for future generations the writings which, concealed by the
people in the walls of their houses or buried beneath the beds
of streams, had escaped destruction. To his praiseworthy efforts
we are indebted for all that remains of the ancient literature,—the
Sacred Books of China, edited by Confu’cius her
admirable philosopher, as well as for the works of Confucius
himself and his disciples.</p>


<p><b>Confucius</b>, to whom we are thus introduced, the <i>reverend
master</i>, the beloved teacher of his countrymen, stands out in
bold relief as the most distinguished personage in Chinese
history. His birth, which took place 551 B.C., was mysteriously
predicted, as legend tells us, on a precious stone found in
his father’s garden: “A child is about to be born, pure as the
crystal wave; he shall be a king, but without territorial dominion.”
Wonderfully has this prophecy been fulfilled; the
child, as we shall see, became a king whose subjects were
numbered by hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>Born in an evil age, when corruption had undermined the
government, and misrule and violence were everywhere rife,
Confucius early dedicated himself to the cause of social and
political reform. At twenty-two he entered upon his work as
a teacher, thoroughly fitted for the high vocation, for he had
been so eager after knowledge as to feel no toil in its pursuit,
and sometimes even to forget his food. His merits were recognized;
and when at last he was raised to the position of
prime-minister, he labored in season and out of season for the
welfare of his people—and with the best results. But then,
as now, princes were ungrateful, and the neglect of his sovereign
led to his resignation. Henceforth the mission of Con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>fucius,
no less useful if humbler than before, was simply to
disseminate his precepts, wandering from state to state among
the fifteen millions who constituted the population of what was
then China. Occupied thus and with the study of the Sacred
Books, he finally found rest in his native state, and there passed
his declining years in the midst of loving disciples, “unconscious,”
as he tells us, “that he had reached old age.” He
died at seventy-three, lamenting that, despite his prolonged
efforts, so little had been accomplished toward elevating the
moral standard of the nation.</p>

<div class="figright illowp40" id="i_p071" style="max-width: 15em;">
  <img src="images/i_p071.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Confucian Priest.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Yet after his death, his influence was destined far to exceed
his most sanguine longings; it has been greater than that of
any other human teacher. No other has ever spoken to so
many millions, or received such honors from posterity. For
more than twenty centuries, his precepts have been taught in
the schools of China (and each little village has its common
school); at stated times, every scholar, on entering in the
morning, still bows in adoration before a tablet sacred to Confucius.
The learned can repeat page
after page from his classical books;
and scores of his maxims are familiar
to the masses, who have positively no
other moral law to guide them. His
tomb, approached by an avenue of cypresses
through a gate of exquisite workmanship,
is inscribed with the words,
“The most sagely ancient Teacher; the
all-accomplished, all-informed King.”
About the spot are imperial tablets
“with glowing tributes to the one man
whom China delights to honor;” and
in the city near by live 50,000 of his descendants,
constituting a distinct class—the
head of the family holding large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
estates as “Duke by imperial appointment and hereditary
right, continuator of the sage.” There is a temple of Confucius
in every city, and Confucian priests superintend various
ceremonies for both mandarins and common people.</p>

<p><b>Tenets of Confucius.</b>—Confucius claimed no divine inspiration;
he founded no new religion. To him the Almighty was
“the Unknown God,” and there was no Paul to declare him
to the philosopher. He avoided referring to a personal Supreme
Being, and thought that the study of themselves should
suffice for men. As to death and a future state, he was
equally reticent. “While you do not know life,” he said to
an inquiring disciple, “what can you know about death?”
With polygamy, then an institution of his country, he found
no fault; and for women as such he appears to have had
no kindly word, or very elevated regard.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp25" id="i_p072" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img  src="images/i_p072.jpg" alt="The one word" />
</div>

<p>The aim of Confucius was to inculcate certain lofty principles
of conduct, to govern men in their relations to each other
and to the ruling powers. Respect for learning, filial piety,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and veneration for the men and institutions of ancient days,
were corner-stones of his system, and are still
deeply impressed on the Chinese mind. His
golden rule “What you do not like when done to
yourself, do not to others”—expressed in written
language by a single ideogram—was the <i>one word</i>
he specially commended as embodying the sum
and substance of duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>The practical workings of this rule, as enforced by the authority
of the great master, were recently exemplified in the
case of an American traveller. As he and his companion
were passing through a Chinese town, their strange faces and
unusual costumes attracted a crowd, and hooting seemed likely
to be followed by serious violence. With admirable presence
of mind, one of the strangers faced the throng, and amid a
shower of mud and stones exclaimed: “Is this the way, O
people! that you obey the precepts of your philosophers, to
treat strangers within your walls tenderly? Have you forgotten
the saying of your great master Confucius,—“That
which I wish another not to do to me, I must not do to
him?” The effect was electric. In a moment every hand
was lowered, and the recent assailants sought as best they
could to make amends for their rudeness.</p>


<p><b>The Chinese Classics</b> comprise the Sacred Books already
alluded to, viz., the Five King; also the Four Shoo, or Books
of the Philosophers (Confucius and the writers of his school).
<i>King</i> is the equivalent of our word <i>text</i>, and the Five Sacred
Texts are the <span class="smcap">Yih</span> King, Book of Changes; the <span class="smcap">Shoo</span> King,
Book of History; the <span class="smcap">She</span> King, Book of Poetry; the <i>Le Ke</i>
King, Book of Rites; and the Spring and Autumn, an historical
record of events in the native state of Confucius, from 721
to 480 B.C. It was written by that philosopher himself, who
so entitled it because “its commendations were life-giving like
spring, and its censures life-withering like autumn.” The first
four King, which rank with the most ancient creations of the
human mind, were compiled and published by Confucius; the
Book of Rites, originally drawn up by the ruler of Chow in
the twelfth century B.C., received additions from subsequent
writers. (<i>See Johnson’s “Oriental Religions: China.”</i>)</p>

<p>Little is known of the true nature of the mysterious Book
of Changes; it apparently relates to divination. The Shoo
King gives us the history of China from the earliest periods to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
about 720 B.C., and contains, besides, discourses on music,
astronomy, and the principles of government. Part of it was
dictated from memory by a blind man after the destruction of
the original tablets.</p>

<p>In the She King, we have a collection of 305 odes and
hymns. Many of them, more than three thousand years old,
were written while the Chinese Empire was as yet a mere
bundle of feudal states; here, as in all other lands, the first
grand thoughts of the people were cast in the mould of poetry.
The odes are in rhyme, and mirror the every-day life and simple
manners of antiquity—often in a highly metaphorical style,
but with a dignity and attractiveness which the later poetry
fails to exhibit. They paint pleasing pictures of rural quiet,
contain delicate touches of nature, and in some few cases display
a high appreciation of woman’s worth; on the whole,
however, the status assigned to the gentler sex is low. Extracts
from the Book of Poetry follow.</p>

<p>The Book of Rites prescribes rules of conduct for all occasions,
from the most important down to a mere interchange
of greetings. With Chinamen ceremonial is everything, and
the influence which this book has exerted on manners and
society for three thousand years cannot be estimated. It is
still the standard of etiquette, a governing board at Pekin
being charged with the duty of enforcing its rigid observance.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn, professedly written in the interests of
morality and good order, to inspire wicked officials and undutiful
sons with wholesome terror, disappoints us in the reading.
It is made up of short, unconnected sentences, stating isolated
facts (some of them quite insignificant) in the baldest manner,
without any attempt at rhetorical excellence or any expression
of condemnation or praise. Whether a temple is struck by
lightning, or a father is murdered by his son, or locusts appear,
or some glorious exploit is performed, or the ruler goes
on a journey, or the sun is eclipsed—it is just stated in so
many words—nothing more. The historical style of Confucius
is certainly not striking, and we fail to see why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
guilty should have “quaked with fear” when his annals appeared.</p>


<p><b>The Four Shoo</b> are constituted as follows: 1. The Confucian
Analects (literary fragments). 2. The Great Learning.
3. The Doctrine of the Mean (as opposed to extremes—the
Moderate). 4. The works of Mencius, or the philosopher
Meng, a disciple of Confucius, and second only to his master
among the sages of China.</p>

<p>The Analects consist of the sayings of Confucius, as they
occur in conversations with his followers. Sententious, simple,
and sometimes signally beautiful, they contain the very
marrow of wisdom based upon observation and experience.
They shine among the laconics of the world. A few specimens
are subjoined.</p>


<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM THE ANALECTS.</p>

<p>“The Master said: ‛In the Book of Poetry are three hundred
pieces, but the design of all may be embraced in one sentence—Have
no depraved thoughts.’</p>

<p>There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not
go on to flower. There are cases where it flowers, but no fruit is
subsequently produced.</p>

is perilous.</p>

<p>Good government obtains when those who are near are made
happy, and those who are far off are attracted.</p>

<p>Three friendships are advantageous,—friendship with the upright,
friendship with the sincere, and friendship with the man of observation.
Three are injurious,—friendship with the man of specious
airs, friendship with the insinuatingly soft, and friendship with the
glib-tongued.</p>

<p>To see what is right and not to do it, is want of courage.</p>

<p>The cautious seldom err.</p>

<p>If I am building a mountain, and stop before the last basketful of

<p>Shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing,

passable characters; but they are not equal to the poor who are yet
cheerful, and the rich who yet love the rules of propriety.</p>

<p>When you transgress, fear not to return.</p>

<p>Were I to say that the departed were possessed of consciousness,
pious sons might dissipate their fortunes in festivals of the dead;
and were I to deny their consciousness, heartless sons might leave
their fathers unburied.</p>

<p>With coarse rice to eat, water to drink, and my bended arm for a
pillow—I have still happiness even with these; but riches and honors
acquired by unrighteousness are to me as a floating cloud.</p>

<p>What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man
seeks is in others.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Great Learning, based on the teachings of Confucius,
and ascribed to one or more of his followers, evinces political
sagacity in its suggestions for the perfecting of government,
insisting that the welfare of the people should be the single
aim, and scouting the idea of any divine right in kings to
rule except in accordance with the principles of justice and
virtue.</p>


<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM THE GREAT LEARNING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ancients who wished to establish illustrious virtue throughout
the empire, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order
well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to
regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing
to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts.</p>

<p>From the loving example of one family, a whole state becomes loving;
and from its courtesies, the whole state becomes courteous:
while from the ambition and perverseness of one man, the whole state
may be led to rebellious disorder: such is the nature of influence.
This verifies the saying: ‘Affairs may be ruined by a single sentence;
a kingdom may be settled by its one man.’</p>

<p>It is not possible for one to teach others, while he cannot teach
his own family. There is filial piety, there is fraternal submission,
there is kindness. Therefore the ruler, without going beyond his
family, completes the lessons for the state.</p>

<p>Never has there been a case of the sovereign loving benevolence,
and the people not loving righteousness. Never has there been a
case where the people loved righteousness, and the affairs of the sovereign
have not been carried to completion.</p>

<p>What a man dislikes in his superiors, let him not display in the
treatment of his inferiors; what he dislikes in inferiors, let him not
display in the service of his superiors. What he hates in those who
are before him, let him not therewith precede those who are behind
him. What he is unwilling to receive on the right, let him not bestow
on the left. This is what is called ‘The principle with which,
as with a measuring-square, to regulate one’s conduct.’”</p>

<p>The Doctrine of the Mean was written by the grandson of
Confucius, who in his boyhood listened to the wise instructions
of the sage, and professed himself ready to carry “the bundle
of firewood his grandsire had gathered and prepared,” thus
leading Confucius to exclaim with delight: “My undertakings
will not come to naught; they will be carried on, and flourish.”
The philosophy of this work is obscure; for while it presents
examples of filial piety, and draws an ideal of the perfect man,
“possessed of all sagely qualities,” who alone is able to “accord
with the course of the Mean,” its language with reference
to that Mean is decidedly mystical. Thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the
mind may be said to be in a state of <span class="allsmcap">EQUILIBRIUM</span>. When those feelings
have been stirred and act in their due degree, there ensues what
may be called the state of <span class="allsmcap">HARMONY</span>. This equilibrium is the great
root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this
harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.</p>

<p>Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and
a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all
things will flourish.</p>

<p>The Master said:—’Perfect is the virtue which is according to the
Mean. Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice
it! I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not walked
in: the knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up to it.’”</p>
</div>


<p><b>Mencius</b>, author of the fourth Shoo, lived in a degenerate
age, but without fear or favor threw himself into the arena to
wrestle with wickedness. In the society around him he found
many fitting marks for his shafts of humor and satire. Purification
of heart was his remedy for evil; the sinlessness of
childhood, his standard of moral purity. “The great man,”
said Mencius, “is he who does not lose his child’s heart.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Virtue and benevolence are insisted on in the voluminous
works of this philosopher—the Plato of Chinese literature as
Confucius was its Socrates<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>—a benevolence that should not
only provide for the physical wants of the people, but also secure
their education and moral advancement. We glean the
following pointed sentences from the</p>


<p class="center">SAYINGS OF MENCIUS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I like life and I also like righteousness. If I cannot keep the
two together, I will let life go and choose righteousness.</p>

<p>When one by force subdues men, they do not submit to him in
heart, but because their strength is not adequate to resist. When
one subdues men by virtue, in their heart’s core they are pleased, and
sincerely submit, as was the case with the seventy disciples in their
submission to Confucius.</p>

<p>The noblest thing in the world is the people. To them the spirits
of the earth and the fruits of the earth are inferior. The prince
is least important of all.</p>

<p>Benevolence brings glory, its opposite brings disgrace.</p>

<p>That whereby man differs from the animals is small. Superior
men preserve it, while the mass of men cast it away.</p>

<p>There is a way to get the kingdom; get the people, and the kingdom
is got. There is a way to get the people; get their hearts, and
the people are got. The people turn to a benevolent rule as water
flows downward.</p>

<p>Mencius said: ‘The richest fruit of benevolence is the service
of one’s parents; of righteousness, the service of one’s elder brother;
of wisdom, the knowing those two things and not departing from
them.’”</p>
</div>


<p><b>Spirit of the Chinese Classics.</b>—One prevailing spirit
breathes through the nine classical books of the Chinese—a
spirit of conservatism. Confucius nowhere encourages
men to take independent flights into the realms of original
thought. He ignores the future, and exalts the past. His
motto was not <i>Go up higher</i>, but <i>Walk in the trodden paths</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
He sought to reclaim from sin and folly, but only by winning
to the purer practices of that venerable antiquity which he
so blindly admired. Beyond the old landmarks, he cared
not even to point the way. (<i>See Gray’s “China,” p. 75.</i>)</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Worshipping the Ancestral Tablet (p.72).</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is hardly strange that under such leadership the nation
became wedded to formalism, wrapped itself in a complacent
aversion to novelty or progress, eschewed dealings with the
outer world, and in a word came to an intellectual standstill
for four and twenty centuries.</p>

<p><b>Other Works.</b>—There are numerous commentaries on the
old classics, some themselves quite ancient; but they are mere
reproductions or servile imitations of the original texts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Different, however, are the works of Lao-Tse, who was contemporary
with Confucius, and whose writings are so mystical
that the matter-of-fact Confucius declared himself unable to
comprehend them. He made something which he calls Tao
the mainspring of the universe, the source and ultimate destination
of all things. Many of his followers, to whom he recommended
self-denial and retirement, became recluses; their
philosophy was perpetuated, and Taoism is still professed to
some extent in China.</p>

<p>Having little imagination for works of fiction and no genius
for the higher departments of poetry, the ancient Chinese produced
nothing of special note—nothing, at least, that has come
down to us—except what has been mentioned. We have indeed
numerous chronicles of the various dynasties, industriously
and no doubt accurately compiled; but they lack the
graces of style, and possess little interest for the general European
reader. The Bamboo Annals, found in a royal tomb
284 A.D., is the oldest of these chronicles that have thus far
come to light.</p>

<p>We are also told that before the Christian Era numerous
treatises were written on philosophy, mathematics, medicine,
military affairs, husbandry, law, and geography; but many of
these perished in the convulsions which afterward shook the
empire. (On the religious books of China, <i>consult Max Müller’s
“Sacred Books of the East,” vols. xvi., xxvii.</i>)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the languages of Siam, Burmah, and Thibet—all monosyllabic
like the Chinese—are also connected literatures
of considerable antiquity. In both Burmah and Siam the
drama, often licentious, has always been popular, its exhibitions
being sometimes prolonged for days. Burmah has
records that purport to carry back its history almost to the
Christian Era. The best writings of the Siamese are imitations
of Hindoo fictions, while the literature of Thibet is
largely made up of commentaries on the Tripitaka.</p>

<p>Bamboo tablets and the stylus, the ancient writing implements; these in the

rags, and worn-out fishing-nets. Books multiply in consequence.

by a smooth board, and then cemented to an iron plate with
a mixture of resin and wax. The production of books thus
greatly facilitated. Chinese books at the present day not
printed from movable types, but from wooden blocks of the

<small><i>HEBREW LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>The Semitic Languages</b>, enumerated on page 16, have certain
peculiarities in common:—</p>

<p>They are triliteral, i. e. three consonants enter into the composition
of every root. Consonants only are represented by
letters; vowels, indicated by points and lines, play a subordinate
part. The latter vary according to the relation to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
expressed; while the consonant root, which conveys the leading
idea, remains for the most part unchanged. Thus, in
Arabic, the notion of bloodshed is expressed by the triple
root <i>q</i> <i>t</i> <i>l</i>; <i>quatl</i> is murder; <i>quitl</i>, enemy; <i>uqtul</i> means to kill;
<i>quatala</i>, he kills. The picturesque compounds, so convenient
in the Indo-European languages, are here wanting.</p>

<p>The Semitic verb is deficient in mood-forms, and has in
general only two tenses, which represent action completed
and action continuing. Case, in the later developments of the
different languages, is left undistinguished. Brevity is gained,
but at the expense of precision.</p>


<p><b>Distribution of the Semitic Tongues.</b>—The great divisions
of the Semitic family of languages are designated as Northern
and Southern Semitic. They include the Arama’ic, Hebræo-Phœnician,
and Arabic, which are much more alike than the
Aryan tongues. Assyrio-Babylonian occupies a peculiar position
between the Northern and Southern Semitic groups.</p>

<p>Aramaic (from the Hebrew Arâm—<i>highlands</i>) was spoken
in northern Syria, Mesopotamia, and Babylonia. A dialect
of it, the Jews gradually adopted after their return from captivity
at Babylon (536 B.C.), retaining the Hebrew as their
sacred language, but speaking and writing in Aramaic somewhat
modified by Greek. Aramaic, therefore, was the tongue
in which our Lord and his disciples conversed.</p>

<p>The Hebræo-Phœnician was spread over Palestine, and included
the dialects of the Ammonites, Moabites, and Philis’tines.
Samaritan was a development of the Western Aramaic,
corrupted by the speech of foreign settlers introduced
into the land of Israel by the Assyrians, to replace the Ten
Tribes whom they had transplanted beyond the Euphrates.</p>

<p>The softer Arabic, musical by reason of its preponderance
of vowel sounds, was carried from Arabia into Africa, where it
was long the language of the cultivated Ethiopians, and where
it still survives in its Abyssinian derivatives, the Amharic, etc.</p>


<p><b>The Ancient Hebrew</b> shares the imperfections of the Semitic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
group to which it belongs. It is one of the oldest members
of this family, and was long thought to have been the original
language of the human race. Its name is derived by some
from Heber, ancestor of Abraham and consequently of the
people who spoke the classical tongue of the Old Testament;
while by many it is believed to mean <i>belonging to the other side</i>,
that is, of the Jordan—an epithet applicable to the Chosen
People as coming from beyond that river to dispossess the
Canaanitish tribes.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p085" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p085.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Semitic Family of Languages.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the days of the patriarch Abraham, whose father dwelt
in “Ur of the Chaldees” (see Map, p. 105), about 2000 B.C.,
the Semitic dialects differed slightly, if at all. Recently sep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>arated
from the primitive stock, they possessed the same roots,
the same grammatical forms and inflections, and conspicuously
agreed in regard to rules of order and construction.</p>

<p>The meagre vocabulary and other defects of the Hebrew
are counterbalanced by its euphony, simplicity, and power of
poetical expression. Conciseness is its crowning merit. A
single sonorous word often conveys an idea that would require
a clause of four or five words in English. The whole range
of literature in other fields affords no such examples of majestic
thought, grand imagery, and impetuous, heart-warming outpourings
of soul, as the poetry of that sublime Hebrew tongue
which was developed by a simple race of shepherds beneath
the mild skies of western Asia.</p>

<p><b>The Hebrew Alphabet.</b>—The Hebrews early profited by the
invention of their Phœnician kinsmen, borrowing from them
an alphabet which, as may be seen on the opposite page, they
changed little from the original. After the Captivity (588-536
B.C.), the more elegant <i>square</i> characters from the Aramaic
took the place of the ancient letters; the latter, however,
for reasons political
as well as religious, were
reproduced on the shekels
coined during the period
of Jewish independence
under the Maccabees
(168-37 B.C.), by which
time the written language was universally expressed in Aramaic
characters. (<i>See Land’s “Hebrew Grammar.”</i>)</p>

<p>The oldest Hebrew alphabet (see Table) contained no more
than ten or twelve letters; the number was afterward increased
to twenty-two—consonants all. These were qualified
by vowel sounds, denoted by vowel-points <span class="imin"> <img src="images/086.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span> placed
over or under the consonants to which they belonged. Capitals
there were none.—While some have held that the names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> of the letters were given them arbitrarily, merely to facilitate
the memorizing of the alphabet, others believe that a connection
existed between their names and their forms: that,
for example, A, called <i>Aleph</i> (ox), was originally a rough
picture of an ox’s head; that B was the representation of a
house or tent, such being the meaning of its name <i>Beth</i>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p><b>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry.</b>—The most ancient Semitic poetry
is found in the pure musical Hebrew of the oldest books of
the Bible. Nearly one half of the Old Testament was in verse,
mainly lyrical, ranging from the simplest song or dirge to the
sublimest strains of prophecy; yet didactic poetry has also a
place, for in it were embodied the proverbs of Israel’s wise
men.</p>

<p>Other literatures boast of their epics and dramas; but the
Hebrew, without either, has exerted a far more exalted influence
on the human mind than any other. In vain do we
search the Veda and the Avesta for conceptions as grand as
those in the Scriptures. God is apprehended in all his majesty
by the Hebrew bards, and speaks through them to nations
that are yet to be. The Bible poets wrote not merely
for the purpose of pleasing; as teachers and prophets, they
had a divine mission and a loftier aim. The graces of rhetoric
were employed to present their impressive subjects in the
strongest and clearest light. Frequent metaphors embellished
their style, and striking personifications endowed it with life
and energy. Imagery drawn from the picturesque scenes
about them,—the hills, the streams, the plains of Palestine,—or
from their every-day employments as tillers and herdsmen,
they used without stint; while <i>parallelism</i>, whether it consisted
in the repetition of the same sentiment or in a contrasting of
opposite ideas, was a peculiar beauty of their poetry.</p>

<p>Their language significant and striking, their thoughts lofty
and solemn, their tone severely moral, their themes of the
deepest interest to man, what wonder that the Hebrew poets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
tower above the sublimest writers of other times and countries?
“Whatever in our literature,” says Taylor, “possesses
most of simple majesty and force, whatever is most fully
fraught with feeling, whatever draws away the soul from its
cleaving to the dust and lifts the thoughts toward a brighter
sphere—all such elements we owe directly or indirectly to
the Hebrew Scriptures, especially to those parts that are in
spirit and form poetic.”</p>


<p><b>Parallelism</b> has been mentioned as a distinctive feature of
Hebrew poetry. This is defined by Bishop Lowth as “a certain
equality, resemblance, or relationship between the members
of a period, so that things shall answer to things and
words to words, as if fitted to each other by a kind of rule or
measure.”</p>

<p>Parallelism may be either cumulative, antithetical, or constructive.
In the first, a proposition, after having been once
stated, is repeated in equivalent words of similar construction,
as in Isaiah, lv., 6, 7:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found;</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Call ye upon him, while he is near.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">Let the wicked forsake his way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">And the unrighteous man his thoughts:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Antithetical parallelism is similar, except that the two periods
correspond with each other by an opposition of sentiments
and terms; as in Proverbs, xxvii., 6:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Faithful are the wounds of a friend;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the third kind of parallelism, there is neither correspondence
nor opposition in the sentiment, but simply a similarity
of construction in the two periods, as in Psalm xix., 8, 9:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<h4>DAWN OF HEBREW LITERATURE.</h4>

<p>There is good reason for believing that the ancient Hebrews
had an extensive literature; but out of their “multitude
of books,” all that have descended to us are those of
the Old Testament. Their secular poetical and prose works
are wholly lost.</p>


<p><b>The Books of Moses.</b>—The earliest Hebrew writer of whom
we have positive knowledge was Moses, author of the greater
part of the Pentateuch<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (<i>five volumes</i>—the first five books of
the Bible), or, as it was called by the Jews, the Book of the
Law.</p>

<p>The first book of the Pentateuch, Genesis (<i>the generation</i>),
tells us all that we know of the Creation, the Deluge, the
Confusion of languages, the Dispersion, and the lives of the
patriarchs, whose history it sketches till the death of Joseph
in Egypt, keeping everywhere prominent the relation of Jehovah
to the chosen race.</p>

<p>Exodus (<i>the going out</i>) continues the story of the Hebrews
from the death of Joseph, relates their oppression under the
Pharaoh Ram’eses the Great, their miraculous escape from
the land of bondage in the reign of his successor, and the
promulgation of the commandments on Mount Sinai. It is in
this book that we catch an early glimpse of Hebrew poetry in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the Song of Moses and his sister Miriam—a magnificent triumphal
ode, the most ancient in any language. The rescued
host pour forth in unison their joy and gratitude; while in
response the exulting prophetess, timbrel in hand, leads the
women of Israel, on the shore of that sea which had engulfed
their enemies, to celebrate their deliverance with sacred
dance and rapturous verse. (See Exodus, chapter xv.)</p>

<p>Leviticus (the book <i>pertaining to the Levites</i>) consists of
regulations relative to worship and sacrifice, together with
historical items touching the consecration of Aaron, his first
offering, and the destruction of two of his sons for their impiety.
Here is developed the theocratic system that lay at
the base of Hebrew society.</p>

<p>Numbers takes its name from the <i>numbering</i> of the Israelites
in the wilderness of Sinai; it gives an account of this
census, and continues their history during thirty-seven years
of subsequent wandering, up to their arrival on the borders
of the Promised Land. In this book there are several brief
specimens of poetry, commemorative of victory, of the digging
of a well in the wilderness, etc.</p>

<p>In Deuteronomy (<i>the second law</i>) the law is repeated and
explained by Moses in three fervid discourses, just before
the entrance of the Hebrews into Canaan. The Pentateuch
closes with a simple but inexpressibly grand outburst of the
Hebrew legislator in song (chapter xxxii.), the blessings he
pronounces upon the twelve tribes, and an account of his
death.</p>

<p>Of the facts presented in these first five books of the Old
Testament, some are confirmed by hieroglyphic inscriptions
and the traditions of different nations; but of the greater
part we should have had no knowledge without the inspired
narrative. Aside, therefore, from its religious bearing, the
Pentateuch is invaluable as an historical record of primeval
ages; while its clear, concise, dignified style, rich with noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
thoughts expressed in the venerable manner of antiquity, is
worthy of its sublime subjects.</p>


<p><b>The Historical Books.</b>—The Pentateuch is followed by the
historical books of Scripture, which, though extending into
the silver age, will for convenience’ sake be here considered
together. With the Pentateuch they form a complete summary
of national history, in which are interwoven religious
matters that explain and illustrate it. We may glance briefly
at their authorship and contents.</p>

<p>The Book of Joshua, classed with the Pentateuch (the Torah,
or Law) under the name of Hexateuch, covers a period
of twenty-five years (about 1425 B.C.); it relates to the conquest
of Canaan and the partition of that promised land
among the twelve tribes, closing with the farewell exhortation
and death of the great leader. Judges, ascribed to the
Prophet Samuel, continues the history of the nation to about
1100 B.C.; it tells how the Jews, as a punishment for their
apostasy, were at different times reduced to servitude by their
heathen enemies, and on their repentance delivered by heroes
who became their Judges. Ruth, regarded by the ancient
Jews as belonging to the Book of Judges, is of unknown date
and authorship, though attributed by some to Samuel. It is
an exquisite idyl of domestic life, designed to show the origin
of King David. (<i>See Chapman’s “Hebrew Idyls.”</i>)</p>

<p>The Books of Samuel, the first portion of which Samuel
probably composed himself, give an account of the magistracy
of that prophet and the reigns of Saul and David. The
Books of the Kings dwell upon the glorious reign of Solomon,
and then take us through the divided lines of Israel and
Judah, till both were finally overthrown and carried into captivity;
Jewish tradition points to Jeremiah as the author of
these books. Ezra seems to have written most of the Chronicles,
which is supplementary to the Kings; he was also the
author of the book that bears his name. This and Nehemiah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
describe the return of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon,
and the restoration of the temple worship at Jerusalem.
The Book of Esther is devoted to a touching episode of the
reign of Ahasuerus, king of Persia, supposed to be identical
with Xerxes, the son of Darius Hystaspis.</p>


<p><b>The Book of Job</b> is worthy of special mention, as the most
artistic specimen of Hebrew genius. Whether this unique
poem was the work of Job himself in his later days, or of some
other whose name is lost, its author was evidently proficient
in all the scientific knowledge of his time. The hero, a native
of northern Arabia, whose name has become a synonym for
patient suffering, is reduced to the very depths by family bereavements,
bodily anguish, and the well-meant reproaches of
his friends; yet his faith in God is unshaken, and in the end
that faith is amply vindicated and rewarded. (<i>See Dr. Rossiter
W. Raymond’s “The Book of Job.”</i>)</p>

<p>Bold imagery, vividness of description, life-like delineations
of lofty passion as well as the gentler emotions, combined
with master-touches of dramatic art, stamp this poem as the
greatest in Oriental literature. Its passages relating to the
war-horse, behemoth, and leviathan (chapters xxxix., xl., xli.),
are cited by writers on the sublime as among the grandest illustrations
of their subject; and its descriptions of the Deity,
as manifested in his works, exhibit the noblest conceptions of
the Infinite that man’s finite intellect is capable of forming.</p>


<h4>GOLDEN AGE OF HEBREW POETRY.</h4>


<p><b>The Psalms.</b>—The flourishing period of David (1085-1015
B.C.) ushers in the Augustan age of Hebrew poetry. The
Lyric was then carried to perfection by the poet-king himself
and his contemporaries in their Psalms,—“those delicate, fragrant,
and lovely flowers,” as Luther calls them, “springing
up out of all manner of beautiful joyous thoughts toward God
and his goodness.” The strains of “Israel’s sweet psalmist,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
who began as a shepherd-lad to cultivate the arts of music and
poetry, breathe a spirit of plaintive tenderness that distinguishes
them from the statelier productions of other contributors
to Hebrew psalmody.</p>

<p>A utopian theory of the great Plato, but one that he declared
could be carried out only by “a god or some divine one,” was
the training of the Grecian youth in odes like the Psalms: and
this—the religious instruction of the people—was the very object
of the Hebrew lyrics. The plan of the Greek philosopher
had been put in practice centuries before his day in Palestine,
and on a far grander scale than ever he imagined. In
the royal city of Jerusalem, four thousand musicians appointed
by David chanted hymns of triumph and praise, to the accompaniment
of harp and flute; while in the gorgeous temple of
David’s son, the sublime worship of Jehovah challenges description.</p>

<p>For three thousand years, these Hebrew anthems, unapproached
by the religious songs of any other age or people,
have been the glory of the Jewish and the Christian Church,
eloquently testifying that “there has been one people among
the nations—one among the millions of the worshippers of
stocks—taught of God.”</p>

<p>Many of the Psalms date from David’s time; one (Psalm
xc.) carries us as far back as Moses, and others were as late
as the Captivity. They were probably arranged as we now
have them in the fifth century B.C.; though certain critics refer
some of them to the Maccabean period (second century B.C.).</p>


<p><b>Elegiac Poetry.</b>—King David was also a writer of elegy,
that kind of song in which the Hebrew poets and prophets
poured out their grief in the unaffected language of
nature. Some of his Psalms are beautiful specimens of
this species of poetry, especially Psalm xlii., “As the hart
panteth after the water-brooks,” composed during his exile
among the mountains of Lebanon. Another exquisite and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
pathetic elegy of this poet, rendered below in English verse
by Lowth, is the</p>

<p><b>Didactic Poetry.</b>—In the golden age, didactic poetry also
reached the acme of perfection. The Proverbs that then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
flowed from the inspired pen of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>, prince of didactic
writers as his father was of lyric poets, are too well known,
with all their richness of practical wisdom, to require more than
a passing mention. Expressed concisely in energetic words,
according to the different forms of parallelism, these moral precepts
are indeed “like apples of gold in baskets of silver.”</p>

<p>Of the same general scope as the Proverbs, and by the same
author, is Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher. In this book is shown
the vanity of earthly pleasures; and the whole duty of man
is summed up in the sentence, “Fear God and keep his commandments.”
The Book of Ecclesiastes has been attributed
to Solomon’s latter days; the Proverbs, to his prime; while
that sweet pastoral, the Song of Songs—singularly beautiful,
whether taken literally as an exponent of happy wedded love,
or allegorically as delineating the mutual attachment of God
and his people—was the joyous outburst of his youth. Solomon
was also the author of a thousand canticles and various
works on miscellaneous subjects; books of making which, he
tells us, there was no end.</p>


<p><b>Prophetic Poetry of the Golden Age.</b>—The writings of the
earlier prophets, florid with high-wrought imagery, revived for
a time the waning glories of the golden age. Foremost of this
class in eloquence of diction, sublimity of thought, and versatility
of genius, stands <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>. Majesty united with elaborate
finish; a harmony that delights the soul; a variety that imparts
freshness without detracting from dignity; simplicity and
unvarying purity of language,—conspire to make the lyric
verse of “the Evangelical Prophet” the most appropriate embodiment
of the awful messages of God to the Jews, the promise
of a Messiah and universal peace.</p>

<p>After a career of nearly seventy years, Isaiah sealed his
great work with his blood in the reign of the idolatrous Manasseh
(698-643 B.C.). His mind has been pronounced “one
of the most sublime and variously gifted instruments which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the Spirit of God has ever employed to pour forth its Voice
upon the world.”</p>

<p>Even the minor prophets, if we except Jonah the oldest, exhibit
in their compositions unwonted grandeur and elegance:
Hosea, with his sententious style; Amos, “the herdman and
gatherer of sycamore fruit;” Joel and Micah; Habakkuk,
whose fervent prayer to the Almighty is graced with the loftiest
embellishments, and Nahum, perhaps the boldest and
most ardent of all.</p>

<p>And so the Golden Age of Hebrew Literature ends. We
know only its sacred poetry, and much indeed of this has disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The harvest and vintage songs which wakened
the echoes amid the vales of Palestine, the pastorals that accompanied
the shepherd’s pipe on the hill-sides of Ephraim,
all are lost forever; “the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
the voice of the bridegroom and the bride,” were forgotten
in the streets of Jerusalem, when the land was desolate
under the Babylonian and “the daughters of music were
brought low.”</p>


<h4>SILVER AGE.</h4>

<p><b>The Prophets.</b>—The names of three great prophets—Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, and Daniel—illuminate the first page in the
history of the decline of Hebrew literature. But in their writings,
and notably so in those of the later minor prophets, poetry
was evidently on the wane. They lived in a degenerate
day. About half of the prophecy of Jeremiah, denouncing the
judgment of Heaven on the disobedient people, is poetry; he
lacks the pomp and majesty of Isaiah, but excels in stirring
the gentler emotions.</p>

<p>His Lamentations are beautiful elegies on the fall of his
country and the desecration of the temple; every letter seems
“written with a tear and every word the sound of a broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
heart.” The verses of the several chapters in the original begin
with consecutive letters of the alphabet, that they may be
the more easily memorized, for it was intended that the sins
and sufferings of the Jewish nation should never be forgotten.
Can anything be more touching than the personification of
Jerusalem, sitting as a solitary widow on the ground and
mourning for her children?</p>

<p>Ezekiel and Daniel were carried captives to Babylon, where
they made known their prophetic visions. The former wrote
partly in poetry, characterized by a rough vehemence peculiar
to himself. The Book of Daniel, in which history is combined
with prophecy, is in prose, and a portion of it in the Aramaic
language. (<i>Consult Keith’s “Evidence of Prophecy.”</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Another writer of distinguished merit, belonging to this age,
was the scribe and priest Ezra (already mentioned), who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
permitted to return from Babylon to Jerusalem with a company
of his people, 458 B.C. He settled the canon of Scripture,
restoring and editing the whole of the Old Testament.</p>


<p><b>The Apocrypha</b> (<i>secret writings</i>) consist chiefly of the stories
of To’bit and Judith, the first and second books of Esdras and
of the Maccabees, Ba’ruch, the Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus
or the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach. Composed
during the three centuries immediately preceding the Christian
Era, they bear internal evidence, in their lack of the ancient
poetical power, of belonging to an age of literary decline.
They were mostly included in the canon of Scripture by the
Council of Trent in 1545, but are rejected by Protestants as
uninspired.</p>

<p>Ecclesiasticus, best of the Apocryphal books, is full of
moral, political, and religious precepts, its object being to
teach true wisdom and its style resembling the didactic poetry
of Solomon. The following fine passage, versified by Lowth,

<p><b>The Talmud.</b>—Our treatise would be incomplete without
some notice of the mysterious book whose name heads this
paragraph,—the Talmud. Comparatively unknown except in
name for centuries, it was repeatedly suppressed in the Dark
Ages by popes and kings, as likely to be dangerous to Christianity.
(<i>See Dr. Jastrow’s “Dictionary of the Talmud.”</i>)</p>

<p>Talmud means <i>learning</i>. It is essentially a digest of law,
civil and criminal, and a collection of traditions orally preserved.
It consists of two parts, viz., the Mishna, or earlier
text; and the Gemara (<i>ghe-mah’ră</i>), a commentary on the
Mishna. The age that gave birth to the Talmud was the
period after the Captivity, when a passionate love for their
sacred and national writings animated the Jews restored to
their country and its institutions. Hundreds of learned men,
all great in their day, who treasured in their memories the
traditions of a thousand years, contributed to its pages.</p>

<p>The Talmud was a cyclopædia treating of every subject,
even down to gardening and the manual arts; it depicts incidentally
the social life of the people, not of the Jews alone,
but of other nations also. It is enlivened by parables, jests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
and fairy-tales, ethical sayings, and proverbs; the style is now
poetical, anon sublime; and there may be gathered amid its
wilderness of themes “some of the richest and most precious
fruits of human thought and fancy.”</p>

<p>After two unsuccessful attempts, the Talmud was finally
systemized in a code by the Saint Jehuda (about 200 A.D.).
A remarkable correspondence exists between it and the Gospel
writings, explained by the fact that both reflect in a measure
the same times. (<i>Read Sekles’s “Poetry of the Talmud.”</i>)</p>


<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM THE TALMUD.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Turn the Bible and turn it again, for everything is in it.</p>

<p>Bless God for the evil as well as the good. When you hear of a
death, say ‘Blessed is the righteous Judge.’</p>

<p>Even when the gates of heaven are shut to prayer, they are open
to tears.</p>

<p>When the righteous die, it is the earth that loses. The lost jewel
will always be a jewel, but the possessor who has lost it—well may
he weep.</p>

<p>Life is a passing shadow, says the Scripture. Is it the shadow of
a tower, of a tree? A shadow that prevails for a while? No, it is
the shadow of a bird in his flight; away flies the bird, and there is
neither bird nor shadow.</p>

<p>Teach thy tongue to say,  ‘I do not know.’</p>

<p>If a word spoken in its time is worth one piece of money, silence
in its time is worth two.</p>

<p>The ass complains of the cold even in July.</p>

<p>Four shall not enter Paradise: the scoffer, the liar, the hypocrite,
and the slanderer. To slander is to murder.</p>

<p>The camel wanted to have horns, and they took away his ears.</p>

<p>Thy friend has a friend, and thy friend’s friend has a friend: be
discreet.</p>

<p>The soldiers fight, and the kings are heroes.</p>

<p>Love your wife like yourself, honor her more than yourself.
Whoso lives unmarried, lives without joy, without comfort, without
blessing. He who forsakes the love of his youth, God’s altar weeps
for him. It is woman alone through whom God’s blessings are
vouchsafed to a house. She teaches the children, speeds the husband
to the place of worship, welcomes him when he returns, keeps
the house godly and pure, and God’s blessings rest upon all these
things. He who marries for money, his children shall be a curse to
him.</p>

<p>Men should be careful lest they cause women to weep, for God
counts their tears.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
<p>The world is saved by the breath of school-children.</p>

<p>When the thief has no opportunity of stealing, he considers himself
an honest man. The thief invokes God while he breaks into the
house.</p>

<p>Get your living by skinning carcasses in the street, if you cannot
otherwise; and do not say, ‘I am a great man, this work would not
befit my dignity.’ Not the place honors the man, but the man the
place.</p>

<p>Youth is a garland of roses; age is a crown of thorns.</p>

<p>The day is short and the work is great. It is not incumbent
upon thee to complete the work: but thou must not therefore cease
from it. If thou hast worked much, great shall be thy reward; for
the Master who employed thee is faithful in his payment. But know
that the true reward is not of this world.”—<span class="smcap">Deutsch.</span></p>

<p class="center">RETURNING THE JEWELS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Rabbi Meir, the great teacher, was sitting on the Sabbath-day
and instructing the people in the Synagogue. In the meantime, his
two sons died; they were both fine of growth and enlightened in the
law. His wife carried them into the attic, laid them on the bed, and
spread a white cloth over their dead bodies.</p>

<p>In the evening, Rabbi Meir came home. ‘Where are my sons,’ inquired
he, ‘that I may give them my blessing?’—‘They went to the
Synagogue,’ was the reply.—‘I looked round,’ returned he, ‘and did
not perceive them.’</p>

<p>She reached him a cup; he praised the Lord at the close of the
Sabbath, drank, and asked again, ‘Where are my sons, that they
also may drink of the wine of blessing?’—‘They cannot be far off,’
said she, and set before him something to eat. When he had given
thanks after the repast, she said: ‘Rabbi, grant me a request.’—‘Speak,
my love!’ answered he.</p>

<p>‘A few days ago, a person gave me some jewels to take care of, and
now he asks for them again; shall I give them back to him?’—‘This
my wife should not need to ask,’ said Rabbi Meir. ‘Wouldst
thou hesitate to return every one his own?’—‘Oh! no,’ replied she,
‘but I would not return them without thy knowledge.’</p>

<p>Soon after she led him to the attic, approached, and took the cloth
off the dead bodies. ‘Oh! my sons!’ exclaimed the father sorrowfully,
‘My sons!’ She turned away and wept.</p>

<p>At length she took his hand, and said: ‘Rabbi, hast thou not
taught me that we must not refuse to return that which hath been
intrusted to our care? Behold, the Lord gave and the Lord hath
taken away; praised be the name of the Lord.’</p>

<p>‘The name of the Lord be praised!’ rejoined Rabbi Meir. ‘It is
well said: He who hath a virtuous wife hath a greater treasure than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
costly pearls. She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and on her
tongue is the law of kindness.’”</p>

<p class="center">THE PAINTED FLOWERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The power of Solomon had spread his wisdom to the remotest
parts of the known world. Queen Sheba, attracted by the splendor
of his reputation, visited this poetical king at his own court. There,
one day, to exercise the sagacity of the monarch, Sheba presented
herself at the foot of the throne: in each hand she held a wreath;
the one was composed of natural, and the other of artificial flowers.
Art, in constructing the mimetic wreath, had exquisitely emulated
the lively hues of nature; so that, at the distance it was held by the
queen for the inspection of the king, it was deemed impossible for
him to decide, as her question required, which wreath was the production
of nature, and which the work of art.</p>

<p>The sagacious Solomon seemed perplexed; yet to be vanquished,
though in a trifle, by a trifling woman, irritated his pride. The son
of David, he who had written treatises on the vegetable productions
‘from the cedar to the hyssop,’ to acknowledge himself outwitted by
a woman, with shreds of paper and glazed paintings! The honor of
the monarch’s reputation for divine sagacity seemed diminished, and
the whole Jewish court looked solemn and melancholy.</p>

<p>At length an expedient presented itself to the king; and one, it
must be confessed, worthy of the naturalist. Observing a cluster of
bees hovering about a window, he commanded that it should be
opened. It was opened; the bees rushed into the court, and alighted
immediately on one of the wreaths, while not a single one fixed on
the other. The baffled Sheba had one more reason to be astonished
at the wisdom of Solomon.”—<span class="smcap">D’Israeli.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="center">NOTES ON WRITING, EDUCATION, ETC., AMONG THE HEBREWS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The art of writing practised by the Hebrews at a very remote period. In
primitive times, records of important events cut in stone; the letters sometimes
filled with plaster or melted lead. Engraving also practised with the stylus on
rough tablets of boxwood, earthenware, or bone. Leather early employed; the
Law written on skins (of “clean animals or birds”) in golden characters. The
skins rolled round one or two wooden cylinders, the scroll then tied with a thread
and sealed. Parchment written on with reed pens, which, together with a knife
for sharpening them and an ink of lampblack dissolved in gall-juice, were carried
in an inkhorn suspended from the girdle. Letter-writing in vogue from the
time of David.</p>

<p>Many ancient Jewish cities far advanced in art and literature. Reading and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
writing from the first not confined to the learned, for the people were required to
write precepts of the Law upon their door-posts, and on crossing the Jordan were
commanded to place certain inscriptions on great stones very plainly, that they
might be read by all. <i>Scribes</i> in readiness to serve those who could not write.
Schools established in different localities in the prophetical age, in which “the
sons of the prophets” lived a kind of monastic life, studying their laws and institutions
along with poetry and music.</p>

<p>After the Captivity, education recognized as all-important, and at length made
compulsory. The Jews in consequence soon noted for learning and scholarship.
$2,500,000 paid by Ptolemy Philadelphus (260 B.C.) to seventy Jewish doctors
for translating the Old Testament into Greek, at Alexandria; hence the <i>Septuagint</i>,
as it is called, or version of the <i>Seventy</i>. By 80 B.C., Palestine filled with
flourishing schools. <i>Jerusalem was destroyed because the instruction of the young
was neglected—Revere a teacher even more than your father—A scholar is greater
than a prophet</i>—common sayings among the Jews. Colleges maintained where
lectures were delivered, and the Socratic method of debate was pursued. Every
student trained to some trade, the ripest scholars working with their own hands
as tent-makers, weavers, carpenters, bakers, cooks, etc. A large library at Jerusalem
composed of volumes in history, royal letters, and various works of the
prophets. The most learned of the later Platonists the Jew Phi’lo (20 B.C.-50
A.D.), who tried to reconcile the Platonic philosophy with the teachings of the
Hebrew Scriptures.</p>

<p>Riddles, enigmas, and play upon words, the chief sources of amusement among
the Hebrews. Dice mentioned in the Talmud. Public games unknown. Fishing
with nets and hooks, favorite sports. Dancing practised as a religious rite;
the stage on which it was performed in the temples styled the <i>choir</i>: each Psalm
perhaps accompanied by a suitable dance.</p>

and Semitic, with a limited intermixture of the Aryan
element. A Semitic dialect prevailed among the people at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
large; but the Turanian (Non-Semitic or Ural-Altaic) Chaldees,
to whom Babylonia was indebted for its aboriginal civilization,
through the centuries of their ascendency, political
and intellectual, not only kept alive their native tongue in
conversation with each other, but, inscribing it on imperishable
monuments, caused it to endure through all time.</p>

  <div class="caption">ASSYRIA and the ADJACENT COUNTRIES</div>
</div>

<p>To these Turanians the honor of having invented cuneiform
letters must be conceded; an honor, indeed, when we remember
that theirs was possibly the most ancient device for
embodying human thought. The characters, called wedge-formed
or arrow-headed, they appear to have brought with
them into the Euphrates valley from the more northerly country
which they previously occupied; and their Semitic co-residents
in Babylonia were not slow in adopting the ingenious
system which they had elaborated. (<i>Consult Budge’s “Babylonian
Life,” By-Paths of Bible Knowledge Series, p. 100.</i>)</p>

<p>The cuneiform characters, like the hieroglyphics, were at
first rude representations of objects, but in most cases the resemblance
to the original was soon lost. In some archaic
forms, however, it may be readily detected; as in the charac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>ter
for fish, <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p106.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span>. The common signs eventually
acquired phonetic values. The Assyrian writing is made up
of ideograms, phonograms, and determinatives.</p>

<p>When by the victory of Alexander at Arbe’la (331 B.C.)
the great Persian Empire fell, cuneiform writing ceased to be
practised, and cuneiform literature was buried in the mounds
of Assyria and Babylonia for two thousand years. During
the present century it has been disinterred by inquisitive
scholars, whose labors have resulted in the restoration of a
forgotten history, through the wonderful literature of a people
long known only in name. (<i>See Sayce’s “Hibbert Lectures.”</i>)</p>


<h4>ASSYRIO-BABYLONIAN LITERATURE.</h4>


<p><b>Writing Materials.</b>—The cuneiform letters heretofore spoken
of as in use among the Persians at a later date (p. 66) were
doubtless originally intended to be cut on rocks with chisels,
and hence were angular instead of round. But the ancient
Babylonians preferred bricks and tablets of clay, on which,
when moist and soft, they traced their legends, annals, and
scientific items, with an ivory or bronze stylus, hardening the
surface thus inscribed by drying in the sun. The tablets, from
one inch in length upward, are pillow-shaped and covered
with characters so minute as to be almost illegible without a
glass. After drying, to insure their preservation, they were
often enclosed in cases of clay, and on these the inscriptions
were duplicated. Such are known as “case-tablets.”</p>

<p>The Assyrians used similar kiln-baked tablets, and, besides,
carved their records exquisitely on the stone panels of their
palaces, and on colossal human-headed bulls. The tablets
above described, together with terra-cotta cylinders, formed the
books of this inventive nation, who also engraved with wonderful
delicacy glass, metals, the amethyst, jasper, and onyx.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>Stone slabs were generally reserved for royal inscriptions;
the literary classes of Assyria preferred the cheaper clay, on
which they could write more rapidly and quite as legibly with
their triangular instruments. Something like paper or parchment
seems to have been used to a very limited extent; but
if so, it has entirely disappeared. It is also thought that the
Chaldeans may have practised a simple method of printing,
as wedge-like types of stone have been found among the ruins
of their cities.</p>


<p><b>Golden Age of Babylonian Literature</b> (2000-1550 B.C.).—Not
a little of the Assyrio-Babylonian literature has been recovered;
but a mine of literary wealth in the valley of the
Euphrates still awaits the persevering student, for before
2000 B.C. important works were written in Chaldea. In the
twentieth century, a golden age dawned on this ancient land;
its great cities became centres of literary refinement, as well
as of commerce and art, and a lofty poetical style characterized
the writings of the time. Standard texts on religion,
science, and history were then and shortly thereafter produced,
the copying of which appears to have satisfied the ambition
of subsequent generations.</p>

<p>In 1887, numerous Babylonian tablets, dating from the 15th
century B.C., were found at Tell-Amarna, Egypt. They contain
letters addressed by Asiatic kings to the third and fourth
Amenophis (a portion of the correspondence relating to the
marriage of an Egyptian monarch with the princess of Mitanni),
and imply that the cuneiform writing of Babylonia was in
that day the vehicle of correspondence, as was the Aramaic
in the time of Persian supremacy.</p>

<p>Among early specimens of Chaldean writing is a set of
bricks, discovered near the site of E’rech. They are thought
to have been made about 2008 B.C. As these bricks illustrate
the most ancient cuneiform character, two of them are
here presented, accompanied with a translation.</p>

<p>Babylonian literature was rich in the departments of law,
mathematics, astrology, grammar, and history. Nor was
fiction wanting; fables, in which the lower animals carried
on spirited dialogues, were favorites with the people. At a
very early date, the inscribed tablets and cylinders were collected,
and the chief cities were made the seats of libraries.</p>

the Rig-Veda, are taken the following verses to the Babylonian

<p>The Babylonians believed in omens. They gathered auguries
from dreams, inspection of the hand, the time of birth,
and various phenomena, establishing a national system of divination
not without its amusing features. For instance, we
have the following</p>


<p class="center">OMENS CONNECTED WITH DOGS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If a blue dog enters into a palace, that palace is burned.</p>

be baleful.</p>

<p>If a spotted dog enters into the palace, that palace its peace to the
enemy gives.</p>

<p>If a dog to the palace goes and on a bed lies down, that palace
none with his hand takes.</p>

<p>If a dog to the palace goes and on the royal parasol lies down, that
palace its peace to the enemy gives.</p>

<p>If a white dog into a temple enters, the foundation of that temple

<p>If a yellow dog into a temple enters, that temple sees plenty.</p>

<p>If a spotted dog into a temple enters, that temple do its gods love.”</p>
</div>

<p>Many charms and exorcisms appear in the ancient language
of Babylonia, disease being attributed to possession by
evil spirits. Specimens follow.</p>


<p class="center">BABYLONIAN EXORCISMS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Wasting, want of health, the evil spirit of the ulcer, spreading

<p>A belief in a future life is expressed in the Poem on the
Descent of Istar, the moon-god’s daughter, to Hades, “the
land whence none return,” where “the dead outnumber the
living;” and further in the so-called Nimrod-Epic, the most
ancient approach to epic poetry known to exist, embodying
the Babylonian story of Izdubar (identified with Nimrod)—his
rejection of the suit of the goddess Istar, and his victory
over the human-headed bull sent to revenge the slight. Nimrod
is ferried across the waters of the dead to the shores of
the regions of the blessed, where he recognizes his ancestor,
Samas-napistim, and exclaims:</p>

<p><b>Chambers of Records at Nineveh.</b>—The Semites who, as the
sacred historian informs us, left the land of Shinar to found
Nineveh and the neighboring cities, carried with them the civilization
and literary culture of the Chaldeans. The earliest
permanent seat of letters was Ca’lah (see Map, p. 105), where,
during the reign of Shalmane’ser II. (860-824 B.C.) many
clay tablets borrowed from the Babylonians were copied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Assyrian scribes. This same king erected at Calah an obelisk
of black marble—one of the few Assyrian monuments of
its kind commemorative of national triumphs.</p>

<p>The library thus begun at Calah was enlarged under succeeding
kings. Removed at length to Nineveh, it there attained
vast proportions through the efforts of that munificent patron
of letters, Sardanapa’lus (Assur-bani-pal), (668-626 B.C.).
The number of engraved tablets reached ten thousand.</p>

<p>Here were grammars<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and lexicons, law-books and scientific
treatises, histories, astronomical and arithmetical works,
songs, prayers, hymns sometimes approaching the Hebrew
sacred lyrics in sublimity, books of charms and omens, natural
histories, botanies, and geographies—a complete encyclopædia
of ancient literature. The books of this curious collection
were carefully arranged according to their subjects, numbered,
catalogued, and placed in charge of librarians. They were
public property, intended for the instruction of the people.</p>

<p>Such was the library of Sardanapalus—principally copied
from Babylonian texts; such, it was buried beneath the ruins
of the palace when “the gates of the rivers were opened and
Nineveh became a desolation;” such, it lay amid the débris
for centuries, “while the cormorant and the bittern lodged in
the upper lintels.”</p>

<p>But the mounds that so long covered the site of Nineveh
have recently surrendered their treasures. Clouds that environed
the history of the past have been dissipated; ancient
nations, for ages wrapped in obscurity, we no longer “see
through a glass, darkly;” and the narrative of the inspired
writers of the Bible has been in many places confirmed by the
inscriptions disentombed in the East. Among the most interesting
fragments found scattered through the ruined “Chambers
of Records” of the Assyrian palace are the tablets relat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>ing
to the Creation, the Fall of Man, and the Deluge, copied
from Babylonian records hundreds of years older than the
Pentateuch.</p>


<p class="center">FROM THE CHALDEAN ACCOUNT OF THE DELUGE.</p>

<p>(Compiled originally about 2000 B.C.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The flood reached to heaven: the bright earth to a waste was
turned. It destroyed all life from the face of the earth, the strong
deluge over the people. Brother saw not brother, they did not know
the people. In heaven, the gods feared the tempest and sought refuge:
they ascended to the heaven of the King of angels and spirits.</p>

<p>Six days and nights passed; the wind, deluge, and storm, overwhelmed.
On the seventh day, in its course, was calmed the storm;
and all the deluge, which had destroyed like an earthquake, quieted.
The sea he caused to dry, and the wind and deluge ended.</p>

<p>I perceived the sea making a tossing; and the whole of mankind
turned to corruption; like reeds the corpses floated. I opened the
window, and the light broke over my face; it passed. I sat down
and wept; over my face flowed my tears. I perceived the shore at
the boundary of the sea. To the country of Nizir went the ship.
The mountain of Nizir stopped the ship; and to pass over, it was not
able. The first day, and the second day, the mountain of Nizir the
same. The third day, and the fourth day, the mountain of Nizir the
same. The fifth and sixth, the mountain of Nizir the same. On the
seventh day, in the course of it, I sent forth a dove, and it left. The
dove went and turned, and a resting-place it did not find, and it returned.</p>

<p>I sent forth a swallow, and it left. The swallow went and turned,
and a resting-place it did not find, and it returned.</p>

<p>I sent forth a raven, and it left. The raven went, and the decrease
of the water it saw, and it did eat, it swam, and wandered away, and
did not return.</p>

<p>I sent the animals forth to the four winds. I poured out a libation.
I built an altar on the peak of the mountain.”—<span class="smcap">George Smith.</span></p>

<h4>HITTITE INSCRIPTIONS.</h4>

<div class="figleft illowp50" id="i_p114" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p114.jpg" alt="As described in text" />
</div>

<p><b>Altaic Hieroglyphs.</b>—Inscriptions on stones and various
objects, in an unknown system of hieroglyphics, have been
found near Damascus and elsewhere in the East. They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
been ascribed to the Hittites (the <i>Khita</i>
of the Egyptian monuments, the <i>Khittim</i>
of Scripture), a powerful race of northern
Syria, who were constantly at war with
the Babylonians, successfully opposed
both Assyria and Egypt, and in the thirteenth
century B.C. extended their power
as far west as the Ægean Sea. It is
claimed that the symbols are “the prototypes
whence the cuneiform system was
developed,” and that the language is an
Altaic (Turanian or Accadian) dialect.
The date assigned is 1400 B.C. (See
opposite engraving of an inscribed stone
from Jerabis.) Scholars are now engaged
in an attempt to decipher these
inscriptions. (The reader is referred to <i>Sayce’s “The Hittites:
the Story of a Forgotten Empire.”</i>)</p>


<h4>ARABIC LITERATURE.</h4>


<p><b>Himyaritic Inscriptions.</b>—The high-spirited war-loving
tribes that roved over the tablelands of Arabia, as well as the
more refined inhabitants of her ports on the Red Sea, doubtless
cultivated letters. We may suppose the former to have
given their florid fancies vent in pastorals, rude songs for the
desert bivouac, or triumphal odes. More finished species of
poetry would have been congenial to the courtly residents of
the cities, whose knowledge of the world was extended by
trading expeditions to India, and along the African coast as
far as the Mozambique Channel.</p>

<p>Yet of this probable literature we possess little that is older
than the era of Mohammed (600 A.D.), at which time the Arabians
awoke to a new life, for centuries leading the van of the
nations in the march of literature and science. But the little
that we have is not without interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>At least eighteen hundred years before the Christian Era,
descendants of Joktan, called Sabæans and afterward Himyarites,
established themselves in southwestern Arabia; but
not until about 800 B.C. do they appear to have gained permanent
dominion over the neighboring tribes. Inscriptions
in their language, the Sabæan, a Semitic tongue closely related
to the Arabic, if not sufficiently like it to be called by
the same name, have been found in the lower part of the Arabian
peninsula on walls, tombs, dikes, and bronze tablets.</p>

<p>These are the oldest known Arabic writings, and are believed
by scholars to date between the 8th century B.C. and
the 4th century A.D. Gems have also been discovered, inscribed
with these same characters.</p>


<h4>PHŒNICIAN LITERATURE.</h4>

<p><b>Its Lost Treasures.</b>—In the most ancient records, the narrow
strip of coast between the Lib’anus Mountains and the
Mediterranean was recognized as an important centre of civilization.
Its cities were seats of art and commerce; Africa,
Sicily, and Spain, were dotted with its colonies and trading-stations;
the sails of its merchantmen sparkled on every sea;
its language was known throughout the ancient world.</p>

<p>It cannot be that a nation so advanced in knowledge was
without a literature; and if works on their philosophy and religion,
on history, geography, navigation, and agriculture, didactic
poems and love-songs, constitute a literature, vast indeed
was that of the Phœnicians. No department of science
or belles-lettres appears to have been overlooked by their
authors.</p>

<p>The famous “Book City,” Kir´jath-Se´pher, which, during
the conquest of Canaan, was taken by Othniel the future
Judge, is thought to have been a Phœnician town. Its name
implies that it was a repository of books, probably public records
and works on law—perhaps an Athens to the nations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Canaan, whither their youth flocked to consult its libraries
and receive instruction at its academies. Its valuable collection
of manuscripts was doubtless committed to the flames
by the Hebrew conqueror.</p>

<p>In like manner, the whole constellation of Phœnician
hymns, and lyrics, and prose pieces, has become extinct, except
a lonely star left here and there in the works of foreign
authors; or a faint light glimmering on some coin or tablet,
gem or tombstone.</p>

<p>The only important Phœnician writer known to us is Sanchoni´athon.
Fragments of his History, written perhaps in
the fourteenth century B.C., have survived through a Greek
translation. In accounting for the origin of the universe, Sanchoniathon
taught the theory of evolution, that “from certain
animals not having sensation, intelligent animals were produced.”</p>

<p><b>Phœnician Carthage</b> also developed an extensive literature.
The records of the city were kept by native historians; and
we know that Ma’go’s great work on agriculture, in twenty-eight
parts, was highly appreciated at Rome, and there rendered
into Latin. When the city of Hannibal fell before her
more powerful rival, her vast library was scattered among the
African allies of the Romans, and lost to history.</p>

<p>An interesting relic of Carthaginian literature is the Circumnavigation
of Hanno, the history of a voyage undertaken
in the sixth century B.C. to the coasts of Libya—the oldest
history of a voyage existing. This work of Hanno, which used
to hang in a temple at Carthage, describes a savage people
called <i>Gorillas</i>, whose bodies were covered with hair and who
defended themselves with stones. The narrator says: “Three
women were taken, but they attacked their conductors with
their teeth and hands, and could not be prevailed on to accompany
us. Having killed them, we flayed them, and
brought their skins with us to Carthage.”</p>

<h4>NOTES ON ASSYRIO-BABYLONIAN LITERATURE.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oldest Semitic cuneiform text written before 3000 B.C. The golden age,
2000-1850 B.C.; oral traditions collected and committed to writing; tile-libraries
in all the principal Chaldean cities. Decline begins about 1550 B.C. The term
<i>Chaldean</i> long synonymous with <i>man of learning</i>.</p>

<p>Rise of Assyrian literature, 1500 B.C.; confined to archives and records for
a number of centuries. Renaissance under Sardanapalus I. and his son Shalmane´ser
II. (885-824 B.C.). Enlargement of the national library in the reign of
Tig´lath-Pile´ser II. (745-727 B.C.) and of Sargon (722-705 B.C.), followed by
a revival of the study of ancient literature. Copies made of the masterpieces of

<small><i>EGYPTIAN LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>The Egyptian Language.</b>—There yet remains one field of
Oriental literature for us to visit, and it is specially interesting
on account of the valuable treasures it long concealed. These
have recently been brought to light in the writings of that
people who settled the fertile valley of the Nile in prehistoric
times, and adorned the land of Egypt with monuments inscribed
with their mysterious characters.</p>

<p>Thousands of inscriptions—some on the walls of vast temples,
or of memorial chapels attached to the tombs of private
citizens; others hewn in the living rock, or carefully cut on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
obelisks of granite with chisels of bronze and steel—have endured
to our day; and thousands of papyri have come down
to us; some of the rolls many feet in length, and covered with
figures of men, birds, insects, and reptiles, in profile, often
illuminated with high colors and gold wrought in artistic
vignettes. The ingenuity of modern science has wrung from
these their secrets, and disclosed a wealth of knowledge in
connection with the history, literature, civilization, and religion
of the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>The Egyptian language is undoubtedly Semitic, and, in its
oldest form, perhaps represents the primitive Semitic stock.
It contains, however, certain elements that are not Semitic,
but that seem to have been derived from a tongue of distinct
origin, spoken in the country before its conquest by a
Semitic race. The language has therefore been called Egypto-Semitic.</p>


<h4>EGYPTIAN WRITING.</h4>

<p><b>Decipherment of the Hieroglyphics.</b>—The decipherment of
the Egyptian hieroglyphics will always be regarded as one of
the greatest triumphs of the present century. As early as
1652, Kircher (<i>kěěr´ker</i>), a learned German Jesuit, attempted
to translate the monumental writing; but, by reason of his
absurd renderings, only cast discredit on the science of Egyptology.
Scholars of the period preferred the study of Coptic,
the language of Egyptian Christianity; it was through their
labors in this field that the way was prepared for the final interpretation
of the older speech.</p>


<p><b>The Rosetta Stone.</b>—The finding of the Rosetta Stone, in
1799, led to the brilliant discoveries of the French savant,
Champollion (<i>sham-pol´le-on</i>). A French officer, while erecting
works at Rosetta, in the delta of the Nile, during Napoleon’s
Egyptian campaign, unearthed a piece of black basalt, which
contained, in equivalent inscriptions in hieroglyphics, Greek,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
and <i>demotic</i> (popular hand), a decree conferring divine honors
on Ptolemy V., a monarch of the second century B.C. The
meaning of the Greek text being known, the hieroglyphics
through it were translated. Thomas Young, an English mathematician,
and the French scholar, independently, and almost
simultaneously, succeeded in finding a true solution of the
problem. Young determined correctly the value of some of
the characters; but the result of Champollion’s labors were
vastly more important. He not only gave the correct rendering
of long inscriptions and of numerous papyri, but pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>pared
an Egyptian grammar and a hieroglyphic dictionary
that for years were unrivalled as authorities.</p>

  <img src="images/i_p119.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Rosetta Stone.</span>
<p>The famous stone rests on a block of red porphyry in the Egyptian gallery of
the British Museum. Dimensions: 3 ft., 1 in. high; 2 ft., 5 in. broad; 6 to 12
in. thick. (<i>Read the “Report of the Committee appointed by the Philomathean
Society of the University of Pennsylvania to translate the Inscription on the
Rosetta Stone.”</i>)</p></div>
</div>


<p>Champollion’s work was carried on by other scholars after
his death. In 1867, Lepsius discovered in the ruins of Tanis
a second trilingual inscription, the so-called decree of Cano’pus,
the study of which fully confirmed the theories previously
advanced. The work of Lepsius gave a new impulse to
Egyptian study. His immediate successor in this line of exploration
was Mariette, who built up the museum of Boulaq.
Many others in France, England, Germany, and America, have
devoted their lives to the study of Egypt and her systems of
writing. The problem that baffled alike Greeks, Romans, and
all subsequent nations, has been solved at last; and the door
has been opened to “a library of stones and papyri in myriads
of volumes,” in which every branch of literature is represented.
The crumbling walls scattered throughout “the Monumental
Land” now utter intelligible words; the very implements and
toys have their stories to tell; and many a tomb has yielded
up its brittle treasure of papyrus, its eulogy or legend, its history
or hymn.</p>


<p><b>System of Writing.</b>—From the earliest times the Egyptians
possessed a phonetic system of writing. They had an alphabet
of twenty-two characters, consisting of consonants only,
which became the basis of the Phœnician, and through it of
every ancient and modern European alphabet. Besides these
consonants, there were in use numerous syllabic signs, in
which two or three consonant sounds, or a consonant and a
vowel sound, were represented by one character. Owing to
the absence of vowel signs, it was often next to impossible to
discriminate between words composed of the same consonants,
but having different significations (as it would be in
English, if, for instance, we should write <i>s t r</i> for <i>star, store,
stair</i>, or <i>straw</i>, and leave the signification of the three consonants
to be determined by the context). To obviate this dif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>ficulty,
the Egyptians early invented a simple system of <i>determinatives</i>.
A determinative is a picture of the object described
by the word in question, and was placed after the
name. Thus the word <i>rômet</i>, signifying <i>man</i>, was followed by
the picture of a kneeling man, <span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p121a.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span> as was also every
word signifying a male human being or his occupation. After
the word <i>himet</i>, signifying <i>woman</i>, after the names of goddesses,
the proper names of women, and all words denoting
female human beings, was placed the picture of a woman sitting.
<span class="imin"> <img src="images/i_p121b.jpg" alt="symbol" /></span> After the names of gods occurred a typical representation
of a god. In like manner, to the names of Egyptian
cities was attached the representation of a plan of a city,
while the picture of a range of hills distinguished foreign localities
(mountains being unknown in the Nile Valley).</p>

<p>Some of these determinatives in time came to be used instead
of the words they originally determined; and thus arose
word-signs (<i>ideograms</i>), which, though at first comparatively
few, soon increased in number. In this way, the picture of
the city’s plan, originally a mere determinative, was eventually
used as the written sign of the word city itself. The Egyptian
system of writing is thus extremely complicated, consisting,
as it does, of an alphabet, syllabic signs, and word-signs
(<i>ideograms</i>), supplemented by a system of determinatives. The
whole number of signs exceeds 2000. (<i>See Moldehnke’s “Language
of the Ancient Egyptians.”</i>)</p>


<p><b>Hieroglyphics.</b>—The oldest form of Egyptian writing is
called hieroglyphic;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> its characters are well-drawn pictures
of natural objects; but these pictures had no ideographic
values. They were originally, as above stated, partly deter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>minative
in their nature. The oldest hieroglyphical texts
that have come down to us have been referred to the II.
Dynasty (now estimated at about 4000 B.C.). The youngest
texts date from the period of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The inconvenience experienced in writing the hieroglyphics
early led to the invention of abbreviated forms. These were
of two kinds, viz., the <i>linear hieroglyphics</i>, and a derivative
therefrom, the cursive <i>hieratic character</i>, suitable for rapid
writing. On some of the stone blocks in the Pyramid of
Cheops (<i>ke’ops</i>), the monarch’s name is inscribed in hieratic
characters; while the oldest texts of the so-called Book of
the Dead are in linear hieroglyphics, which remained the favorite
form for this religious work, as well as for most funeral
papyri. There are two kinds of hieratic—one closely resembling
the old linear hieroglyphics, and in common use during
the Middle Empire (2100-1700 B.C.); the other, a simplified
and abbreviated form, introduced early in the period styled
the New Empire (about 1530 B.C.). From this second form
of hieratic, the Phœnicians derived their alphabet (see p. 20,
and plate p. 87). In the seventh century B.C., the hieratic
gave place to the still simpler <i>demotic</i>, which has not inaptly
been called Egyptian short-hand.</p>


<h4>LITERARY REMAINS.</h4>

<p>Egyptian literature, like other ancient literatures, passed
through periods of development and decay. It had its dawn
or archaic period, its classical and Augustan era, and its age
of decline.</p>


<p><b>The Archaic Age of Egyptian Literature</b> was the epoch of
the Old Empire (3800-2400 B.C.) From this remote period
there have come down to us mainly inscriptions carved on
the walls of private tombs and royal pyramids. The earliest
religious writings, comprising the oldest portions of the Book
of the Dead, date also from this time; and a few popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
songs remain, but they are difficult of interpretation. There
is further a compilation of maxims, attributed to Prince Ptahhôtep,
who lived about 2500 B.C. The style of the archaic
period is simple, clear, and forcible; the writings are, in the
main, intelligible. As specimens, we present the entire text
of one inscription, with extracts from another:</p>


<p class="center">INSCRIPTION ON THE SARCOPHAGUS OF KING MENKAURÂ
(3700 B.C.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“O Osiris, king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Menkaurâ,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> immortal
one! Thy father is the heaven, thy mother is Nut (goddess of the
heavens), thou art of the family of Qeb (god of the earth). Thy
mother Nut bends over thee in the shape of her divine secret. She
enables thee to be a god; no longer hast thou enemies hereafter,
thou immortal king of Upper and Lower Egypt!”</p>
</div>


<p class="center">FROM THE INSCRIPTION OF UNA,<br />

<span class="allsmcap">A GENERAL OF THE VI. DYNASTY</span> (2400 B.C.).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This army went in safety; it devastated the land of the Bedouins.
This army went in safety; it destroyed their fortifications.
This army went in safety; it cut down their fig-trees and grape-vines.
This army went in safety; it killed their troops there by
many thousands. This army went in safety; it took very many
prisoners alive. His majesty praised me for this above everything.
His majesty sent out this army five times to devastate the land of
the Bedouins, every time they rebelled. I acted so that his majesty
praised me above everything.”—<i>Wendel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The first extract is of interest as being a translation of the
oldest religious text yet found. (On the monuments, <i>consult
“Records of the Past,”</i> 1874-1889; <i>and Maspero’s “Les Contes
Populaires de l’Egypte.”</i>)</p>


<p><b>Classical Age of Egyptian Literature.</b>—After the Archaic
period there is a great blank in Egyptian history; but about
2100 B.C. we begin again with trustworthy accounts. It
would appear that Egypt had been subjected, at the close of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Dynasty VI., by foreign invaders, who were expelled by the
Theban princes of Dynasty XI. The final regeneration of
the empire, however, was accomplished by Amenemhât I., the
founder of Dynasty XII., which, with the following, covers the
period commonly called the Middle Empire (2100-1800 B.C.),
at the close of which Egypt fell a prey to the Hyksos, or
Shepherd Kings.</p>

<p>This epoch was regarded by later native writers as the
classical age of their literature. It is represented by large
numbers of inscriptions, and some remarkable papyri. Among
the latter are the so-called Prisse papyrus,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a collection of
ill understood moral maxims attributed to Prince Ptahhôtep;
and the memoirs of Prince Saneha, a noble of the time, who
was forced to fly from Egypt, and for many years lived among
the Bedouins of Asia. Other works of the period are “The
Instructions of Amenemhât I. to his son Usertesen I.,” the
oldest version of the famous “Minstrel’s Song” (sometimes
called the “Festal Dirge”), and several fairy stories, notably
the “Tale of Snake Island.” The style of the literature is
obscure. Much of it was unintelligible even to scholars of
the succeeding periods.</p>

<p>Under the Hyksos, phenomenal encouragement appears to
have been given to the study of science. A mathematical
hand-book of considerable merit reflects the tendencies of
the time, as does more markedly the interesting “Papyrus
Ebers,”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the oldest medical work in the world—both dating
from the 17th century B.C.</p>

<p>Selections from two prose works, and a poem entire, follow,
in illustration of the style of the Classical Age:</p>


<p class="center">FROM THE MEMOIRS OF PRINCE SANEHA.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>This noble, who held a high command in the army, having been
implicated in a conspiracy against King Amenemhât I., was compelled
to fly the country, and lived for many years in Syria, among
the Bedouins. The Memoirs contain interesting details of his Arab
life. He tells us that on reaching the eastern boundary of Egypt,
he encountered a line of forts stretching across the isthmus as a protection
against the Bedouins. “Then I hid in the bushes for fear
the sentinels on the wall would see me. In the night I went on,
and reached the land of Peten by daybreak. As I approached Lake
Qemwer, thirst came upon me, and my throat was parched; so I said,
‘this is a foretaste of death.’ Suddenly my heart took new courage,
and I arose—I had heard the lowing of a herd. I saw a Bedouin.
He gave me water, and cooked milk for me.”</p>

<p>Then Saneha proceeds to relate how he found his way into Syria,
and was cared for by the king, who gave the fugitive the hand of
his daughter in marriage; for the prince had heard who Saneha
was, and “all his prowess,” from Egyptians dwelling at the court.
“He let me choose a tract from the finest lands on the border of
another country. This was the beautiful district of Aaa; there
grow in it figs and grapes; it has much wine, and is rich in honey;
abundant are its olives, and all kinds of fruits grow on its trees.
Wheat and barley mature there, and herds unnumbered find pasturage.
And yet greater grace he showed me in making me sheik of a
tribe. Every people against which I went, I conquered and drove
away from its pastures and wells. I stampeded its herds, enslaved
its children, plundered its stores, and killed the people with my
sword, my bow, and my wise plans.”—After living in Syria for some
years, Saneha was pardoned by his king, and returned to Egypt.</p>
</div>


<p class="center">THE TALE OF SNAKE ISLAND.</p>

<p>This charming tale relates how a treasury official is wrecked
on an island in the Red Sea, while on his way to the mines
of Sinai. The island is ruled by a great serpent, and inhabited
only by snakes. The official remains for some time the
guest of the prince, and is then dismissed loaded with presents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was travelling to the mines of the king, and had gone to sea
on a ship 150 yards long and 40 yards broad (compare with the size
of modern vessels), that was manned by 150 of the best Egyptian
sailors, who knew heaven and earth, and whose hearts were wiser
than those of the lions. When we were at sea, a storm arose; and
as we approached land the wind grew stronger, and the waves were
eight yards high (only in most violent storms are waves observed
whose height from crest to trough is 40 feet). I alone caught hold
of a piece of timber; all the others that were on the ship perished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
A wave cast me on an island. There I found figs and grapes, melons,
fish, and birds. I ate, and of what I had taken too much I laid
aside. Then I lighted a fire, and sacrificed to the gods.”</p>
</div>


<p class="center">THE MINSTREL’S SONG (2150 B.C.).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Song which is in the house of the late king Antef, and which is
before the minstrel. It is a wise decree of that Good Lord, a perfect
fate, that while one body passes away others remain, ever since the
time of our ancestors! The gods that once lived (the dead kings)
now repose in their tombs The mummies are buried. When
houses are built, there is no room for them. What has become of
them? I have heard the sayings of Imhotep and Hardedef (two
sages), which are sung in numerous lays: ‘What are now their
places? Their walls are fallen; they are no more, even as if they
had never been.’ No one chants their good qualities or their deeds;
no one decides that our hearts shall go where they have gone.</p>

<p>“Thou art in good health; thy heart revolts against the funeral
rites. Follow thy heart while thou livest. Put perfumes on thy
hair, don fine linen! Anoint thyself with the finest of the salves of
the gods! Do more than thou hast hitherto done! Let not thy heart
grow sore! Follow thy desire and thy happiness while thou dwellest
on the earth, until that day comes for thee when men will pray,
and the god whose heart no longer beats (Osiris) hears not those who
pray! The lamentations will not rejoice the dead. Have a good
time! Assuredly none take their possessions with them! Assuredly
no one that hath gone hath yet returned!”—<i>Wendel.</i></p>
</div>


<p><b>Golden Age of Egyptian Literature.</b>—With the expulsion
of the Hyksos by Theban kings (1530 B.C.), the New Empire
began; it continued until about 1080 B.C., and was contemporaneous
with the Golden Age of Egyptian letters. Under
the New Empire, the Egyptian dominion was extended eastward
into Asia, and far to the south in Ethiopia. Foreign
successes kindled the native imagination; hence the general
tone of gayety which pervades the literature of the period.
Religious works naturally occupy the first place. They comprise
commentaries on the older theological writings embodied
in the Book of the Dead,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> long rituals and liturgies, and
numerous sublime hymns to the gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p127" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p127.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Papyrus, from the Collection of the New York Historical Society.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The secular literature is peculiarly brilliant. Magnificent
hymns to the kings, legendary accounts of historical events
like “The Taking of Joppe” and “The Expulsion of the
Hyksos,” charmingly told fairy tales, accounts of travel and
adventure, and spirited lyrics—give us an exalted opinion of
the literary ability of Egyptian writers. Even an epic is not
wanting, if we may so call the poetic description of the battle
of Rameses II. with the Hittites. The inscriptions are of
great value, for it is from them we have derived our knowledge
of the history of the period. Both kings and private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
citizens have left coherent accounts. Nor was science neglected.
Several medical papyri have been found, and in certain
tombs have been preserved veritable treatises on astronomy
and long astronomical tables. The style is attractive,
clear, and vigorous, owing to the fact that the grammatical
forms have increased in number, thus permitting a more
easy and varied expression. (<i>See Erman’s “Ægypten,” vol. ii.,
p. 442</i>). Literary specimens follow:</p>


<p class="center">HYMN TO THE SUN GOD RÂ.<br />

<small>(FROM THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.)</small></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hail to thee who art Râ when thou risest, and Atum when thou
settest! Thou risest, risest and glowest, glowest crowned as king
of the gods! Thou art Lord of heaven and earth, creator of stars
and men! Thou art the sole god who hath existed from the beginning,
who hath made the lands and created men, who hath made the
heavens and created the Nile, who hath made the waters and endowed
with life all that therein is! Thou who hath built the hills
and created men and the beasts of the field!”—<i>Wendel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The genius of the poets of the Golden Age may be estimated
from the following verses discovered on a monumental
tablet among the ruins of Thebes. They are represented as
addressed by Amen-Râ (<i>ah’men rah</i>), the supreme god of that
city, to Thothmes III., under whom (15th century B.C.) Egypt
rose to the zenith of her military greatness, and, according
to a popular saying of the day, “placed her frontier where
it pleased herself.” The hymn is peculiarly beautiful in the
original, by reason of the harmonious cadence of its periods,
and that parallelism or “balance of clauses and ideas” which
is largely characteristic of Oriental poetry.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>It was by Thothmes III. that the obelisk conveyed from
Alexandria to the United States and erected in Central Park,
New York (1880), was inscribed with hieroglyphics and set
up among “the images of On.” Rameses II. subsequently
added to the inscription of Thothmes. (<i>Read Dr. Moldehnke’s
“The New York Obelisk.”</i>)</p>


<p class="center">AN EGYPTIAN EPIC.</p>

<p>Among the relics of this age of literary culture are several
copies of an epic celebrating the prowess of Rameses the
Great in a war with the Hittites—the only representative of
its class in all the literature that has been recovered. It has
been compared to the Iliad, but lacks many of the qualities
which have rendered that poem immortal. The grand central
scene, vividly portrayed by the hand of a master artist,
discloses the king, forsaken by his cowardly troops in the
heat of battle, calling on Amen for aid, and with the god’s
assistance discomfiting single-handed the hostile multitude.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How is this, father Amen? Doth the father forget his son?
Naught have I done without thee. Did I not march at thy word?
What would these Asiatics before Amen? Miserable he who know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>eth
not the god. Have I not reared to thee unnumbered monuments
and filled them with booty? Shame on him who would scorn thy
will! Hail to him who knoweth thee, Amen! I call on thee, my
father.</p>

<p>I am in the midst of many peoples! I am alone, my infantry and
charioteers have left me! When I called upon them, no one heard
me. When I called upon them, I found that Amen was better for
me than millions of foot-soldiers and thousands of charioteers, of
brothers and sons united. Vain are the works of men; Amen is
mightier. He is coming to me! He giveth me his hand! I take
courage again! I shoot right and left. I am as a pestilence over
them!”</p>
</div>


<p class="center">THE TALE OF THE TWO BROTHERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the most beautiful of the old fairy tales is that bearing the
title above. It sets forth the rustic life of two devoted brothers;
the false accusation of one by the wife of the other; the flight of the
accused after a warning given him by his faithful cattle; his pursuit
by the elder brother, and his miraculous escape; the reunion of the
brothers; many strange adventures, terminating in the elevation of
the younger brother to the throne of Egypt, and of the elder to the
proud position of hereditary prince.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a curious fact that, with few exceptions, we are left
in ignorance of the names of the Egyptian authors. The papyri
generally conclude with a remark to the effect that they
have been copied at the instance of the royal scribes.</p>

<p><b>The Period of Decline</b> began about 1080 B.C. Demotic
literature contains but two noteworthy works—“The Romance
of Setna,” a weird tale of magic, and a half-legendary
history known as the “Demotic Chronicles.” Demotic fables,
in which animals are represented as conversing, appear to
have been imitations of Greek originals. The writings of this
period are in the main religious.</p>

<p>Such is the literature which the sands of Egypt have yielded
to modern research—a literature which, itself of greater
antiquity, furnished models even to the nations that we call
ancient. While these later nations, judging from the remains
that have thus far come to our knowledge, certainly improved
on their masters in artistic finish and grandeur of conception,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
it must be remembered that we have not yet fully sounded the
depths of Egyptian literature. We know not what masterpieces
may still lie hid beneath the sand, or bear the mummy
company in some undiscovered tomb. We are, indeed, justified
in expecting greater works from the land that was the
fount of Greek inspiration—the dayspring of knowledge to
the Chosen People; whose religion bears in many points a
strange analogy to ours; whose lasting structures are emblematic
of the soul’s immortality; and whose lotus-blossoms, reopening
every morning, symbolize the resurrection from the
night of death.</p>


<h4>NOTES ON EGYPTIAN EDUCATION, ETC.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Egyptian education in the hands of state officials, who gave instruction in
the duties of their several offices. In ancient times, boys born on the same day
with a prince educated with him. Those that were to become scribes, sent to
school at a very early age; the same advantages enjoyed by poorer pupils as by
their richer fellows. No castes. After the children had learned to write, they
were given old texts to copy in the form of letters, moral treatises, tales, hymns,
etc. Thus they mastered the grammar of their language, and at the same time
became acquainted with its literature. Schools dismissed at noon; boys employed
during the afternoon in the practical work of the department. Corporal
punishment in great repute. Students of theology afterward entered at temple
schools. No mention made of the education of girls.</p>

<p>Particular attention bestowed on astronomy and elementary mathematics.
Arithmetic and geometry taught; possibly the rudiments of algebra. Considerable
progress made in medical science; Egyptian physicians versed in materia
medica and physiology, and thoroughly familiar with anatomy. They were
adepts in surgery, and practised specialties. Mummies found with gold fillings
in their teeth, and bandaged as skilfully as by an expert of to-day.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians excelled all other nations in their fondness for recording.
The chisel or reed ever busy. Red and black ink employed in inscribing
papyri, the former marking the openings of paragraphs. Inks and colors kept
in pots fitted in depressions in the oblong palettes.</p>

<p>Dancing, gymnastics, games of ball and draughts, fishing in preserves, or in
the swamps of the Delta with hooks, nets, and spears, spearing the hippopotamus
from canoes, and hunting wild fowl in the marshes—favorite pastimes.
Ladies present at the sports and sumptuous banquets. A keen eye for humor
manifested in the fondness of the Egyptians for caricature, from which even
their representations of funeral ceremonies were not exempt.</p>

<small><i>BIRTH OF GRECIAN LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Early Settlement of Greece.</b>—While Chaldea and Assyria
were rising to greatness, while Phœnicia was winning for herself
maritime supremacy, and wonders in art and science were
spreading the renown of Egypt throughout the earth, a simple
agricultural people was quietly moving westward toward Greece
and Italy. In very early times, Aryan tribes known as <i>Pelasgic</i>
quitted their habitations in southwestern Bactria (Map,
p. 15), and made their way through Persia and Mesopotamia
into Asia Minor. Here, on rich tablelands irrigated by the
head-waters of streams flowing into the Black Sea and the
Mediterranean, presumably among the gold-bearing mountains
and vine-grown valleys of Phrygia (see Map), they cultivated
their grain, pastured their sheep, made permanent
settlements, and rapidly grew into a great nation. These
Pelasgic tribes were the ancestors of the Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p>The same general causes that led to emigration from the
mother-country crowded toward the coast communities of this
Phrygian people, and ultimately obliged them to seek new
homes in the west. Perhaps, paddling from island to island
in rude galleys, some crossed the Æge’an; perhaps, passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the Hellespont, some picked their way through Thrace and
Macedonia, entered the defiles of the northern mountains, and
spread over Greece; while others, more adventurous, pushed
their course still farther, and peopled the Italian peninsula.</p>

<p>The Pelasgic tribes were probably the first occupants of
Greece and Italy. Earlier emigrants from Asia appear to have
found all they desired in the accessible districts of central Europe,
and not to have climbed the steep ranges that hemmed
in those regions on the south. The Greeks themselves claimed
with pride to have sprung from the earth; and a golden grasshopper,
worn in the hair as an ornament by the Athenians,
pointed to this belief in their <i>autochthony</i>.</p>


<p><b>The Hellenes.</b>—Fresh bodies of Pelasgians continued to arrive
from Asia Minor, until all Greece was populated with a
thrifty race of husbandmen and shepherds. Upon this primitive
Pelasgian stock was afterward engrafted a branch called
Hellenic, identical with it in origin, but forced to a higher state
of development in the garden of Asiatic culture, and ready to
burst into blossom on the soil of Greece. The new-comers
were the Helle’nes, a people of greater vigor, physical and intellectual.
Mingling with their Pelasgian kinsmen in the Grecian
peninsula, they formed a new nation, endowed with fresh
life; and the Pelasgic dialect, modified and energized by their
more cultivated tongue, was converted into <span class="smcap">Greek</span>.</p>

<p>The Greeks had a popular proverb, <i>do nothing too much</i>,
which they applied in writing as in acting. Pruning away too
great exuberance and repressing the Oriental tendency to exaggerate,
they reduced everything to the standard of a rigid
but elegant correctness. More artistic than the Hindoos, less
luxuriant in imagination but with a chaster and severer taste,
they established a literature richly furnished in every department,
whose influence can be traced in the works of genius
that stand out in every age and country. As Professor
Jebb says, “the thoughts of the great Greek thinkers have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
been bearing fruit in the world ever since they were first uttered.”
(<i>See Dr. Curtius’s “History of Greece.”</i>)</p>

<p>Thus in Greece, Aryan energy, freed from the trammels of
Oriental despotism, seems first to have found its true development.
The facilities which this country enjoyed for intercourse
with Egypt and Phœnicia, enabled it to draw from the learning
of one, to copy the enterprise and adopt the inventions of
the other. This accounts for its having been the seat of the
earliest European civilization.</p>

<p>At a later period, we find the Hellenes separated into three
great families—the Æolians, occupying generally the north of
Greece; the Ionians, distributed over the central portions; and
the Dorians, settled in the south (the Peloponnesus, <i>island of
Pelops</i>). Connected with these three divisions were as many
dialects—Æolic, Ionic, and Doric Greek—of which, Ionic was
the softest and most polished. This Ionic, refined and perfected,
became what is known as Attic Greek; it was the language
of Athens in the golden age of her art and poetry, and
for centuries was understood by the educated classes throughout
a great part of the civilized world.</p>

<p>These Hellenic dialects were also spoken on the islands of
the Ægean and the coast of Asia Minor; for the tide of emigration
set back again toward the Asiatic shores, and Æolians,
Ionians, and Dorians, returned in great colonies to the neighborhood
of their early home.</p>


<p><b>Ancient Greek</b> is the most musical language of the Indo-European
group. Sanscrit indeed excels it in regularity, but
offends the ear with its sameness, the constant recurrence of
a sounds wearying the European reader. No such monotonous
repetition mars the harmony of Greek, which, on the other
hand, presents a pleasing variety in its vowel sounds, its
numerous diphthongs, and consonant combinations. Nor is
this variety to be wondered at, for tribes differing in their habits
and intellectual traits, mingling on the shores of the Æge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>an,
contributed different elements to the common language.
Above all, the Greeks were gifted with a delicate ear, which
led them, in the oral transmission of their earliest poetry, to
soften all harshness in their tongue and make it melody itself.</p>

<p>In common with Sanscrit, Greek was well adapted to the
formation of compound words by the combining of primitives;
but this facility for combination was turned to account only so
far as was consistent with clearness and taste; the unwieldy
polysyllabic compounds of Sanscrit were wanting. The Greek
rivals its Indian sister in luxuriance of inflection also, having
five cases, three numbers, and three voices for the verb. Accents
were used in later days to denote the peculiar key or
tone of voice; for the Greeks appreciated the subtle difference
between <i>tone</i> (accent) and <i>quantity</i> in pronunciation, a distinction
unrecognized in modern languages.</p>

<p>Greek is universally admired for its dignity, versatility, and
precision; its blending of strength and elegance, unity and
variety. It is suited to all departments of composition; to the
effective expression of the various emotions; to stately prose
or simple verse. Its perfection at so early a period, particularly
in view of the social condition of the people who spoke
it, is a phenomenon which we vainly seek to explain.</p>

<p><b>The Greek Alphabet.</b>—The Phœnician letters were adopted
by the Greeks, legend ascribing their introduction to Cadmus,
the storied founder of Thebes (1500 B.C.). Some changes
were made in these; new characters were added by the Ionians;
and about 400 B.C. the resulting alphabet, consisting of
twenty-four letters, was officially adopted at Athens. The resemblance
between the Greek and the Phœnician alphabet is
obvious; see Table, p. 87.</p>

<p>That there was Pelasgian picture-writing in Greece before
the Phœnician alphabet reached that country, is by no means
improbable.</p>

<p><b>The Beginnings of Greek Poetry</b> are found in the sacred ode,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the metrical response of the oracle, the festal song, and the
ballad immortalizing the deeds of heroes during the mythical
ages. The art of poetry was coeval with the first settlement
of the peninsula; but its higher development followed the
transfusion of Hellenic genius into the older Pelasgian race.</p>

<p>The earliest forms of poetry were hymns to the deities. The
religion of the Greeks was a worship of Nature. Imagination
peopled every nook of their picturesque land with supernatural
beings; and each was propitiated with song, from the wood-nymph
supposed to reside in the spreading oak to the sun-god
Apollo, who, with the Nine Muses, the goddesses of poetry,
abode on snow-crowned Parnassus.</p>

<p>To Mother Earth (Deme’ter) were poured forth strains of
glowing gratitude for her bounty; the Mother of the Gods
(Cyb’ele) was worshipped with wilder verse, accompanied with
the sound of cymbals and riotous dances; the god of wine
(Diony’sus or Bacchus) was hymned with lively lays in praise
of revelry; and so the burden of sacred song varied with the
character of the divinity. When spring clothed the earth with
beauty, the hymns were joyous; in autumn they breathed a
spirit of sadness, and at the grape-harvest was sung a plaintive
ditty, the Li’nus, as a coranach for the death of Nature. The
perishing of vegetation before the blighting breath of approaching
winter was symbolized by the fate of the beauteous youth
Linus torn and devoured by furious dogs. Of similar allegorical
significance were many of the hymns.</p>

<p>The delights and sorrows of domestic life also found utterance
in verse; when the bride was escorted to her new home
the nuptial song was sung, and for the dead the funeral dirge
was chanted. At first this was no doubt done with solemn
pomp, as a religious ceremony; but the tendency in Greece
was to popularize song, and both dirge and bridal hymn in
time lost their mere ritual complexion, and became changed
in the mouths of the people into free outpourings of emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>The bard now aimed at entertaining his listeners; he filled
an important place at banquets and festivals, where, in short
poems, he chanted to the accompaniment of flute or lyre the
adventures of heroes, or so transformed old traditions that he
was looked upon as their maker (<i>poie’tes</i>, <i>poet</i>). All Greece
honored him, regardless of his nationality. Whether Æolian,
Dorian, or Ionian, he contributed equally to Hellenic fame, and
was entitled to the sympathy and support of all Hellenes.
Indeed, he was invested with a sacred character, for he was
regarded as divinely inspired.</p>

<p>Thus was laid the foundation of Greek letters. From such
rude beginnings, the Greek imagination, by strides unparalleled
in history, mounted to the grandest heights ever attained in
poetry. Moreover, to original Greek genius we owe the different
varieties of literary composition,—epic, lyric, and dramatic
poetry, history, criticism, and oratory. Without the Grecian
models, nowhere has marked superiority been attained; the
originals themselves have never been surpassed.</p>

<p>Tradition has given us the names of many poets belonging
to the fabulous age. (On the gods and men of the Heroic
Period, <i>read Gladstone’s “Juventus Mundi.”</i>)</p>

<small><i>AGE OF EPIC POETRY.</i></small></h3></div>


<h4>HOMER AND HIS WORKS.</h4>

<p><b>Homer.</b>—The oldest literary productions of Greece extant
are the poems of Homer, the most ancient monuments of Aryan
poetry west of the Persian Gulf. About 1000 B.C., among
the legion of ballad-writers, the reciters of battle-songs, myths,
and traditions (known as Rhapsodists—<i>ode-stitchers</i>), there
arose an Ionian poet who soon towered head and shoulders
above them all—a giant among the giants of literature—<span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
of unique genius and world-wide fame.</p>

<p>As to Homer’s life, we must ever remain in the dark. For
the honor of giving him birth, seven cities of antiquity disputed,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Smyrna seeming to have the best claim. If we may believe
tradition, he gave early evidence of his divine powers.
Chance took him on a sea-voyage, during which he visited
many countries, among them Ithaca, the home of Ulysses, one
of his heroes. On the island of Chi’os, his favorite resort, he
is thought to have written his epics the Il’iad and Od’yssey,
the first in early manhood, the second in old age.</p>

<p>Legend relates that Homer, twice warned by an oracle to
<i>beware of the young men’s riddle</i>, went ashore one day on I’os,
an island of the Cyc’lades, and there, noticing some boys who
had been fishing, asked them, “What luck?” “What we
caught we left, what we could not catch we carried with us,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
was the reply. Unable to guess the riddle, the old poet died
of vexation. According to another account, disease carried
him off. He was buried on the sea-shore at Ios, where in after
years this epitaph marked his tomb:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here Homer the Divine, in earthy bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poet of heroes, rests his sacred head.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><b>Homer’s Style.</b>—Homer’s Iliad was the first Greek poem in
which were combined ingenuity of plot, unity of subject, and
a faithful delineation of character throughout. He deals with
heroes, but they are men of like passions with ourselves. The
Odyssey, if less sublime, in its pathos and fine touches of nature
shows the same rich gifts of genius as the older poem of
loftier flight. Both works are written in hexameter verse, the
true metre of the ancient epic.</p>

<p>The distinguishing features of Homer’s style are clearness,
a vigor which makes us feel we are in the presence of a master,
and a childlike simplicity that well accords with his sublime
themes. His fidelity to nature is matched only by Shakespeare’s;
and imagery, profuse as it is rich, life-like, and appropriate,
lights up every page. Simile is Homer’s own figure;
and transporting pictures flash ever and anon across the scene,
called up by his magic wand. For example:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As when, high-fed with grain, a stall-bound steed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Snaps his strong cord, and flies, from bondage freed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strikes with resounding hoof the earth, and flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the wide champaign spread before him lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeks the remembered haunts, on fire to lave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His glowing limbs, and dash amid the wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High rears his crest, and tossing with disdain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wide o’er his shoulders spreads his stream of mane,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fierce in beauty, graceful in his speed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Snuffs his known fellows in the distant mead:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus Hector—”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As a young olive, in some sylvan scene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crowned by fresh fountains with eternal green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lifts its gay head in snowy flowerets fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And plays and dances to the gentle air;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">When lo! by blasts uprooted, whirled around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Low lies the plant, extended on the ground:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus in his beauty young Euphorbus lay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Homer astonishes us with his universal knowledge. He
names every part of a vessel technically with all the accuracy
of a veteran seaman; he is as conversant with the details of
a sacrifice as the officiating priest; he describes a conflict between
two warriors with the precision of a master of fence; he
sketches the forms and usages of palaces as if born and bred
in kings’ courts, and is equally familiar with the manners of
the meanest hind. Everywhere he is at home.</p>

<p>Other poets<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> may be stars in the firmament, but Homer, as
Longi’nus says, is the sun in the zenith. His poetry is all
nature, life, action, fire. It breathes an atmosphere of pure
morality, and furnishes ideal characters long held up as models
to the Grecian youth, who learned his verses by heart and
in some cases could even repeat his entire poems. Human
genius has left on earth at intervals of centuries a few imperishable
monuments; none nobler among these than the marvellous
Greek epics.</p>


<p><b>Plan of the Iliad.</b>—The Iliad, a poem of twenty-four books,
is a tale of the siege of Troy (Il’ium), a city on the coast of
Asia Minor (probable date of the siege, 1194-1184 B.C.).
The cause of the war was the perfidious conduct of Paris, son
of Priam, the Trojan monarch. Hospitably entertained at the
court of Menela’us, king of Sparta, he eloped with Helen, the
wife of his host, the most beautiful of women, and carried her
off to Asia with the treasures of her husband. To avenge this
outrage, Menelaus, supported by Nestor the sage of Py’los,
called upon the Greek princes, collected an armament of a
thousand ships, the command of which was conferred upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
his brother Agamemnon, and set sail for Troy. A war of ten
years followed, which ended in the capture of the city by stratagem,
the slaughter of Priam and his family, and the enslavement
of many of the Trojans.</p>

<p>The special subject of the Iliad is the wrath of the Thessalian
Achilles (<i>a-kil’leez</i>), the leading warrior of the Grecian
host, and the time of the action is near the close of the war.
Agamemnon, compelled to restore to her father, a priest of
Apollo, the captive maid Chryse’is who had fallen to his share,
seizes upon Brise’is, a virgin allotted to Achilles. A quarrel
results, and Achilles withdraws from the camp.</p>

<p>Emboldened by his absence, the Trojans redouble their efforts.
Misfortunes to the Greek cause follow; and though
many heroes second only to Achilles—the stalwart Ajax, the
cunning Ulysses, king of Ithaca, Menelaus, and Diomede—exert
themselves to turn the tide of battle, the Greek host is
made keenly to feel the loss of its puissant champion. Jupiter,
king of heaven, sides with the Trojans; and Hector “of
the dancing helm-crest” drives the besiegers to their ships.</p>

<p>At length Achilles, still unwilling to join in the fray himself,
allows Patro’clus, his bosom-friend, to lead his Myrmidons
to the rescue. Arrayed in the armor of the Thessalian chief,
Patroclus puts to flight the deceived Trojans; but, pursuing
them too far, receives a death-wound from the hand of Hector.
The news of his friend’s fall fills Achilles with thirst
for revenge. A reconciliation is effected with Agamemnon;
Achilles returns to the field; the enemy are thrown into confusion;
and Hector, pierced by his spear, is dragged in triumph
at Achilles’ chariot-wheels. The wrath of the Greek hero is
finally appeased by the sacrifice of twelve Trojan captives at
the funeral of Patroclus.</p>

<p>To redeem the body of his son, old Priam, alone and unarmed,
enters the Grecian camp, is well received by Achilles,
who melts into pity at the sight of the grief-stricken suppliant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
accomplishes his purpose, and returns to Troy with Hector’s
corpse. This meeting between Achilles and Priam is counted
among the finest scenes.—The Iliad closes with the obsequies
of Hector. (<i>See Gladstone’s “Homer and the Homeric Age.”</i>)</p>

<p>Achilles, the central figure of the poem, over whose grave
Alexander wept jealous tears, was the impersonation of youthful
beauty and physical prowess. Brave, generous, passionate,
devoted in his friendship but awful in his implacable anger, in
him we are brought face to face with the ideal of Greek chivalry.
Hector, the magnanimous Trojan hero, was the type of
moral courage and domestic virtue. He appears as the affectionate
husband, the loving father, kind even to fallen Helen.
Homer has painted with exquisite touch a parting scene between
Hector and his consort Androm’ache, possessed of every
wifely virtue. This passage, herewith presented, is pronounced
the most beautiful in the Iliad.</p>

<p>The ancients implicitly believed the story of the Iliad, but
modern scepticism has doubted its truth and questioned the
authenticity of the poem itself. The German critic Wolf and
others have even gone so far as to deny that any such person
as Homer ever existed, contending that the name means
simply a <i>fitter together or compiler</i>, and that the great epic is a
mosaic of romantic legends by different rhapsodists, for years
kept from perishing merely by oral repetition.</p>

<p>Such, however, is the continuity of the narrative, the identity
of style, the consistency in carrying out the several characters,
that this theory, ingeniously as it has been urged, lacks credibility.
We see no reason to doubt that, despite a few minor
discrepancies, one great intellect gave birth in the main to
both these epics; that whatever foundations for them may
have been laid in previous ballads, the glorious superstruct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>ures
were reared by one master-builder. It is easier to believe
that there was one transcendent genius, than that there
were half a dozen of uniform poetic power, competent to have
had a hand in works so glorious—works displaying perfect
unity of design, and taste so faultless that from them, as
standards, have been deduced the very principles of criticism
and laws of epic poetry.</p>

<p>Besides the internal evidence of its authenticity, the historical
facts woven into the Iliad have received unexpected confirmation
in the discoveries of Doctor Schliemann, a German
explorer who claims to have unearthed the Ilium of Homer,
and to have found among its ruins gold and amber ornaments
once worn by King Priam.</p>


<p><b>Plan of the Odyssey.</b>—In the Odyssey, divided like the Iliad
into twenty-four books, Homer has immortalized the story of
the return-voyage of Ulysses (<i>Odysseus</i> in Greek) from Troy
to Ithaca. After a series of remarkable adventures and hair-breadth
escapes, the hero is cast on the lovely island of the
sea-nymph Calypso, who, becoming enamored of him, detains
him for seven years. During this time, a number of insolent
suitors force themselves upon Ulysses’ faithful wife Penelope,
take up their residence at her court, and there lead a riotous
life, hoping that the queen will bestow her hand on one of
them and thus make him lord of Ithaca. They even plan the
murder of her son Telem’achus.</p>

<p>Admonished by Jupiter, Calypso reluctantly allows Ulysses
to depart, and he finally reaches Ithaca in safety. Disguised
as a beggar, he enters his palace after an absence of twenty
years, to endure the insults of the suitors, but to concert with
his son for their overthrow.</p>

<p>On the following day, a great festival is held, and Penelope
agrees to give her hand to him who shall send an arrow from
Ulysses’ bow through a row of twelve rings. The suitors try
in turn without success; but the beggar, obtaining possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of the bow, draws the shaft to its head and accomplishes the
feat. Then turning on the trembling suitors, he showers his
arrows among them, and none escape. The true-hearted
Penelope is restored to him whom she had wept as lost, and
husband and wife sit down together to talk over the sorrows
of the past.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“She told him of the scorn and wrong</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She long had suffered in her house,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Each wooing her to be his spouse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How, for their feasts, her sheep and kine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were slaughtered, while they quaffed her wine</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Of all the sorrowing tasks he bore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She listened with delighted ear;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Till all the tale was o’er.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ulysses next discovers himself to his father; and they two,
with their friends, succeed in putting down the adherents of
the suitors and restoring peace to the kingdom.</p>

<p>Among the most beautiful passages of the Odyssey is that
in which the poet introduces us to the happy household of
Alcinoüs, king of an island on which Ulysses was thrown.
Charming is the simple sketch he gives of the unaffected
princess of this isle, just before her marriage, driving her
maidens to the river in her father’s chariot, to wash the robes
of state, lunch, and disport upon the bank while the clothes
are drying. The royal mother superintends the weaving, the
royal daughter the washing. We quote Homer’s description
of the</p>

<p><b>Minor Poems of Homer.</b>—The Iliad and the Odyssey are the
only authentic productions of Homer. To their author, however,
have been attributed about thirty hymns and several
minor poems, which have little claim to so distinguished an
origin. Of these, “the Margites,” a satire on a blockhead
who knew much “but everything knew ill,” was probably
the work of some clever Athenian in an age when epic poetry
was a thing of the past; the poem is no longer extant.</p>

<p>“The Battle of the Frogs and Mice,” a mock heroic of comparatively
modern birth, is still preserved and appreciated.
It is a witty burlesque on the Iliad (perhaps the earliest burlesque
extant), written in a bold and flowing style. The plot
is brief. A mouse, Crumb-snatcher, son of the Mice-king, flying
from an enemy, reaches a pool over which a courteous
frog, Puff-cheek, undertakes to carry him. But during the
passage a water-snake appears; the frightened frog dives to
escape his foe, and thoughtlessly leaves his newly-made friend
to drown. The mice gather to avenge the loss of their prince;
a great battle ensues, and but for the interference of Jupiter
the frogs would have been annihilated.</p>

<p>The so-called <span class="smcap">Homeric Hymns</span>, which the ancients believed
to be the work of Homer, if somewhat inferior in age to the
Iliad and Odyssey, are undoubtedly older than the pieces
named above. Those addressed to Apollo, Mercury, Venus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and Ceres, the finest in the collection, are regular poems of
some length; the others are simple eulogies or brief preludes
to longer pieces. The Hymn to Venus has a tenderness and
warmth not unworthy of Homer. The one in honor of Ceres
relates the abduction of her daughter Pros’erpine by Pluto,
king of the lower world, the mother’s search for the stolen
maiden, her anger on discovering the ravisher, and the final
arrangement that the goddess shall enjoy the society of her
daughter during two-thirds of the year. As a favorable specimen
of its style, we cite the lines that follow:—</p>

<p>There are also various fragments styled Homeric, supposed
to have been dropped from the poet’s genuine or spurious
works. Among these is the beautiful couplet quoted by
Plato:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Asked and unasked, thy blessings give, O Lord!</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><b>Cyclic Poets.</b>—After the death of Homer, a host of imitators
sprung up in Greece and Asia Minor. Rhapsodists by profession,
as they wandered among the Grecian cities reciting
the Homeric poems, their attention was naturally directed to
epic composition, and they sought to supply in verse like Homer’s
what the Iliad and Odyssey had left untold. Confining
themselves to the Cycle (<i>circle</i>) of the Trojan War, they were
called <i>Cyc’lic</i> poets.</p>

<p>One bard sung of the preparations made by the Grecian
chiefs and the events of the war prior to Achilles’ withdrawal;
two others took up the narrative where the Iliad left it, and
described the sack of Troy; a fourth celebrated the return
voyages of the Greek heroes; a fifth supplemented the Odyssey
with the later history of Ulysses. Fragments only of
these Cyclic epics survive.</p>


<h4>HESIOD AND HIS WORKS.</h4>

<p><b>Hesiod.</b>—Homer was an Ionian of Asia Minor. Shortly
after his time, or, as some think, contemporaneously with him,
a new school of epic poetry appeared in the mother-country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Its founder was Hesiod, who, like Homer, wrote in the Ionic
dialect.</p>

<p>Hesiod was born at Ascra in Bœotia, and brought up in the
midst of rural life at the base of Mount Helicon. Here first
he held free converse with the Muses. On his father’s death,
he was defrauded of his portion of the estate by his younger
brother Perses, who bribed the judges charged with making
the division. Hesiod felt the wrong keenly, yet seems to have
regarded his unnatural brother with fraternal interest; for one
object of his poem entitled “Works and Days,” was to reclaim
Perses from dissolute improvidence and incite him to a life of
industry.</p>

<p>The first portion of this work is devoted to moral lessons;
some in a proverbial form, and others illustrated by narratives
and fables. The latter part contains practical directions for
the husbandman, and also treats of the art of navigation, important
to the Bœotian farmer because much of his produce
was shipped to other countries. The whole abounds in excellent
precepts for every-day life, and forms the earliest specimen
of didactic poetry among the Greeks. For ages its lines
were committed to memory and recited as part of the course
of ethics in their schools.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the “Works and Days” is “the Theogony,”
devoted to the genealogy and history of the Grecian
gods, thirty thousand in number. Whatever interest this poem
may have possessed for the believer in the Greek mythology,
to the reader of the present day it is for the most part tedious,
though relieved by occasional grand descriptions of battles
between the celestial personages. “The Shield of Hercules”
also bears the name of Hesiod; and of works ascribed to him,
but not now extant, there are about a dozen.</p>

<p>Hesiod mentions a poetical contest between himself and
another, which took place at the funeral of Amphid’amas, king
of Eubœa, and in which he obtained a tripod as a prize. Tradition
mentions Homer as his competitor on that occasion,
and even gives the inscription placed on the tripod by the
victor:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This Hesiod vows to th’ Heliconian Nine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Chalcis won, from Homer the divine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this part of the story rests on insufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Hesiod is said to have been slain, during a visit to the Locrian
town of Œnoë, by two brothers, in revenge for an insult
offered to their sister by Hesiod’s companion, which caused
her to destroy herself. The poet’s body, thrown into the sea,
was brought to shore by his dog, or as some say by dolphins.
Thereupon the indignant people put the murderers to death
and razed their dwellings to the ground—an incident which
shows the sacredness attached to the vocation of the bard in
those early times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Though Hesiod ranks far below Homer, and indeed is often
commonplace, yet at times his style exhibits enthusiasm and
even rises to sublimity. We must respect him for the pure
morality of his teachings.</p>

<h4>NOTES ON GREEK WRITING, ETC.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The language of epic poetry perhaps once the common tongue of the people,
and merely elaborated by the bards. The art of writing, old in Greece; while
there is no positive evidence of its being known before 800 B.C., the historian
Herodotus (450 B.C.) speaks as if it had been familiar to his countrymen for
hundreds of years. Homer’s epics, though by some thought to have been handed
down by oral repetition, probably written on metallic or wooden tablets by their
author. Hesiod’s works originally committed to leaden tables and deposited in
the temple of the Bœotian Muses.</p>

by priests and bards, particularly at the temple of Delphi.</p>

<h4><i>LYRIC POETRY.</i></h4>


<p><b>Rise of Lyric Poetry.</b>—For more than two hundred years
after Homer and Hesiod, no one worthy of the name of poet
appeared in Greece. Greek genius seemed to have exhausted
itself. A few feeble imitators of the great master, and epic
poetry was no more. The spirit of the Iliad and the Odyssey
died with the monarchies whose chieftains they immortalized.
When popular governments arose, the bard no longer celebrated
the gods and demigods of the past, or traced the genealogies
of kings, but sung the glories of his country, or poured
forth without restraint the emotions of his soul. Thus lyric
poetry was the child of liberty.</p>


<p><b>Varieties.</b>—At the beginning of the seventh century B.C.,
there was a new birth of poesy; Grecian song burst forth
once more, from hearts throbbing with enthusiasm at the triumph
of free institutions. Solemn dirges and stately hymns
chanted by olive-crowned youth bearing offerings to the gods,
were no longer paramount; ballads full of human feeling,
lyrics appealing directly to the people—to the patriot, the
artisan, the shepherd, the lover, the pleasure-seeker—struck
chords that vibrated in many hearts. Feasts afforded frequent
occasions for outbursts of national feeling, it being the
custom of the guests to pass a branch of myrtle from hand to
hand, each as he received it repeating an appropriate verse.</p>

<p>A favorite banquet-song of the fifth century B.C. was the
following eulogy of Harmo’dius and Aristogi’ton, the Athenian
heroes who slew the tyrant Hipparchus:—</p>

<p>The flower-songs of the Greeks were especially beautiful;
children enjoyed their nursery rhymes; while in the Lay of
the Swallow, the penniless bard, chanting at the gate, sought
an avenue to the charity of his rich neighbor.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And a cup of red wine our thirst to slake.”—<span class="smcap">Mure.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The creations of the lyric muse are graceful, touching, and
true to nature. We regret not to exchange the sublime heights
of epic poetry for an humbler field in which we may commune
with the joys and sorrows, the hopes and fears, of humanity.
Here, as Tegner says, Greek poetry arises “slender, smooth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
erect like the palm-tree with its rich yet symmetrical crown;
and a nightingale sits among the leaves and sings.”</p>


<h4>THE ELEGY.</h4>

<p>The Ionians, first to free themselves from kingly rule, gave
to the Hellenic world the earliest forms of lyric poetry,—the
elegiac couplet and the lighter iambic verse appropriate to
satire. These twin-born metres, of Ionian parentage, grew up
side by side in Greece. In the elegiac couplet, a dactylic line
of five feet or their equivalent followed the sonorous hexameter,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
constituting a livelier measure than the old heroic verse,
which consisted of hexameters alone.</p>

<p>The Greek elegy was not necessarily plaintive; on the contrary,
it did good service in rousing to action in time of war,
and gave fitting expression to the spirit of the banquet-hall.</p>

<p><b>Callinus.</b>—The inventor of this metre was Calli’nus of
Eph’esus, in Ionia, who flourished between 730 and 678 B.C.
He attempted by it to excite his countrymen against a horde
of barbarian invaders; but the people were too much enervated
by intercourse with the effeminate nations of Asia to
respond to his thrilling strains.</p>

<p>The following is a fragment of Callinus, perhaps the oldest
war-elegy in existence:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How long will ye slumber? When will ye take heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fear the reproach of your neighbors at hand?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fy! comrades, to think ye have peace for your part,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whilst the sword and the arrow are wasting our land!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shame! grasp the shield close! cover well the bold breast!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Aloft raise the spear as ye march on the foe!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With no thought of retreat, with no terror confessed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hurl your last dart in dying, or strike your last blow!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! ’tis noble and glorious to fight for our all—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For our country, our children, the wife of our love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Death comes not the sooner! no soldier shall fall</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ere his thread is spun out by the sisters above.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once to die is man’s doom; rush, rush to the fight!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He cannot escape, though his blood were Jove’s own;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a while let him cheat the shrill arrow by flight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fate will catch him at last in his chamber alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unlamented he dies—unregretted? not so,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When, the tower of his country, in death falls the brave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice hallowed his name amongst all, high or low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As with blessings alive, so with tears in the grave.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent20"><span class="smcap">H. N. Coleridge.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><b>Tyrtæus.</b>—Another proficient in this variety of elegy was
Tyrtæus, supposed to have been born in the Attic town of
Aphidnæ. He led the Spartans in the Second Messenian
War (685-668 B.C.), they having, by the direction of an
oracle, sent to Athens for a general, to secure the success
which had before been denied them. The story is that the
jealous Athenians despatched to their neighbors a deformed
schoolmaster, the cripple Tyrtæus, in the belief that his services
would be of little value; but they mistook. The greatest
military genius could not have accomplished more; for
Tyrtæus, by his wise counsels and inspiriting war-songs, made
his soldiers invincible. Messenia fell, and her citizens became
slaves to the Spartans. Nor, afterward, was the poetry
of Tyrtæus less efficacious in quelling civil dissensions and
establishing domestic peace. In every respect, “the Muse
of Sparta,” as he was called, proved to be to his adopted
country the blessing promised by the oracle.</p>

<p>Tyrtæus is said to have invented the trumpet, and introduced
it as a companion to the flute, then the chief instrument
in use. Some have interpreted the lameness of the bard as
signifying his limping measure, the second line of the elegiac
couplet being, as we have seen, a foot shorter than the first.</p>

<p>Of the many productions of Tyrtæus, consisting of marching-songs,
as well as warlike and political elegies, only a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
fragments survive. His poems, characterized by terseness
and impassioned power, were long popular among the Spartans,
who, on a campaign, were wont to recite them after each
evening meal to kindle afresh their martial fire.</p>

<h4>THE SATIRE.</h4>


<p><b>Archilochus</b> of Pa’ros (728-660 B.C.) was the first great
satirist, the inventor of that rapid, loosely-constructed iambic
measure so admirably adapted to his withering lampoons.
The son of a slave-woman, Archil’ochus was treated with indignity
in his native island; so bidding adieu to “the figs and
fishy life” of Paros in early youth, he sailed with a colony to
Tha’sos in the northern Ægean. His new home, however,
disappointed his expectations; its gold-mines yielded not the
fortune he had dreamed of, and he denounced it as “the sink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
of all Hellenic ills.” The colonists becoming engaged in war
with a neighboring people, a pitched battle proved too severe
an ordeal for the poet’s courage, and dropping his shield he
fled.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was for this cowardly action, perhaps on account
of his empty purse, that when he returned to Paros, one of its
fair daughters, who had been his boyhood’s love, refused him
her hand. Her father, also, denied his suit; whereupon the
furious poet poured forth in stinging verses such a torrent of
violent invective upon the girl and her whole family, that she,
her father, and her sisters, are said to have taken refuge from
his scurrilous attacks in suicide.</p>

<p>The public odium thus excited drove Archilochus from Paros.
But the brand of cowardice was upon him. The Spartans,
whose mothers, pointing to the battle-field, were wont to
say “Return with your shields or upon them,” disdained the
man who could write,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That shield some Saian decks, which, ’gainst my grain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I left—fair, flawless shield—beside the wood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, let it go! I and my purse remain:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To-morrow’s bull-skin may be just as good.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Insult met him at every step, till a poetical victory at the
Olympic Games restored him to popular favor. He went
back to Paros, an old man, to redeem his reputation as a soldier
by dying in battle with the Naxians. Then all Greece
awoke to the greatness of his genius; and the prediction of
an oracle before his birth, that he would be “immortal among
men in the glory of his song,” was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Fertility of invention, and an intimate acquaintance with
human nature, were conspicuous in the poetry of Archilochus.
Elegies and love-songs flowed from his pen, and his philosophical
poetry gained for him from Plato the epithet of “Wisest;”
but it was in satire that classical writers conceded to him the
highest rank. Archilochus likens himself to a hedgehog bris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>tling
with quills, whose “one great resource is worth all the
devices of more powerful animals.” From his birthplace, ill-natured
satire has been called <i>Parian verse</i>.</p>

<p>So little remains of the writings of this author that we can
hardly decide whether his countrymen judged aright in reckoning
him second only to Homer. The two represented distinct
departments of poetry; each in his own, it was claimed,
fell little short of perfection. Where Homer praised, Archilochus
reviled. Their birthdays were celebrated in one grand
festival, and a single double-faced statue perpetuated the memory
of the Epic Poet and the Parian Satirist.</p>

<p>Greek satire had other representatives, whose names will
be found at the end of this chapter; but their genius was
of a lower grade.</p>


<h4>ÆOLIC AND DORIC SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p>Lyric poetry was the peculiar province of the Æolian and
Dorian Greeks, who carried it to perfection. The Æolic writers
were replete with intense passion, and employed lively metres
of simple structure. The Dorian lyric, intended to be sung
by choruses or to choral dances on great occasions, funerals,
marriages, or public festivals, was a much more majestic, but
at the same time a more intricate and artificial composition.
The most distinguished composers of the Æolic School were
Alcæus and Sappho; of the Doric, Simonides and Pindar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>


<p><b>Alcæus</b> flourished in the latter part of the seventh century
B.C. He was a noble of Lesbos, and lived in the stirring times
when the constitutional and the aristocratic party contended
for the sovereignty. In this struggle Alcæus appears as the
deadly foe of democratic rule; when his friend Pittacus was
clothed with supreme authority by the people, Alcæus directed
against him the keenest shafts of his satire. Pittacus defeated
him in an attempt to overthrow the government, but generously
spared his life, saying, “Forgiveness is better than revenge.”
Of the poet’s subsequent career we are ignorant.</p>

<p>The ancients were loud in their praises of Alcæus. His
poems were polished, full of vehemence and passion, sublime
in their denunciations of tyranny and encomiums of freedom.
Love and wine were two of his favorite topics; yet even his
jovial pieces were pervaded by a loftiness of sentiment foreign
to mere sensual songs. Among his most beautiful compositions
were the odes to Sappho, whose love he once sought, but
whose genius soared to greater heights than his. We take
from Alcæus</p>

<p><b>The Lesbian Poetesses.</b>—Lesbos was the centre of lyric
song. To its shores, the waves of ocean are fabled to have
borne the lyre of Orpheus, which the people hung in Apollo’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
temple: thus traditionally distinguished by fate, it became
renowned as the home of Grecian poetesses.</p>

<p>The Lesbian women were not confined to domestic duties,
but were allowed to take part in public affairs. They founded
societies for the cultivation of their literary tastes, and before
all Greece vindicated the genius of their sex. And Lesbos
was the very clime for poetry to ripen in. The love of the
beautiful was fed on every side. The island was a paradise
of groves and rivulets, of blossoms and perfumes. Among its
olive-clad hills, at its fountains set in violets and fringed with
fern, under its stately pines, and in its temples shining with
ivory and gold, its poetesses received their inspiration.</p>


<p><b>Sappho.</b>—Greatest of these, and queen of her sex in intellectual
endowments, was Sappho, “the Lesbian Nightingale,”
“spotless, sweetly-smiling, violet-wreathed,” as Alcæus fondly
described her, whom all Greece knew as <i>The Poetess</i>.</p>

<p>In her history it is difficult to separate the true from the
fabulous. Born at Mytile’ne, the capital of the island, in the
latter part of the seventh century B.C., she was deprived of a
mother’s care at the age of six. In early womanhood, a new
calamity befell her in the loss of her husband, and thenceforth
she devoted her genius to letters, making the elevation of her
countrywomen the great object of her life. Her reputation
soon spread throughout Greece. Mytilene became the seat
of a brilliant sisterhood eager in the study of the polished
arts; sparkling conversation enlivened its meetings; music and
poetry were the branches its members specially cultivated;
love was the common subject of their verse; their lives were
above reproach. In the centre of this constellation of gifted
women blazed Sappho, “Star of Lesbian Song.” Greece, captivated
by her sweet numbers, accorded her a place by Homer’s
side—then raised her to the level of its goddesses as
“the Tenth Muse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

  <img src="images/i_p166.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Lover’s Leap.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Ancient story made Sappho the victim of disappointed love. Overcome with passion for Pha’on, a beautiful Mytilenean
youth notorious for his heart-breaking propensities, and finding
Phaon indifferent to her advances, she is said to have
thrown herself from the Leuca’dian promontory<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and drowned
her passion in the Ionian Sea. There is, however, no evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
to support the story; on the contrary, the poetess seems to have
been implicated with Alcæus in a conspiracy against Pittacus,
who then ruled in Lesbos, and to have been banished in consequence.
(On the Æolic school of Sappho, <i>consult Donaldson’s
“History of the Literature of Ancient Greece,” p. 218</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sappho’s Style.</span>—Simplicity, tenderness, concentrated passion,
and brilliancy of description, are characteristic of Sappho’s
verse. Her poetry is the very language of harmony;
no more musical measures than hers were known to the
Greeks. Her favorite stanza, an invention of her own, consisted
of four lines with a cadence like the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tenderest mistress | of the heart’s emotion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over whom love sweeps | as the mighty ocean,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unto thee pour we | all our soul’s devotion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Glorious Sappho!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In depicting love, Sappho is unmatched. Her utterances,
indeed, were so intense as to be misconstrued by the sensual
Greeks of a later day, and give rise to reports injurious to her
good name; or possibly she may have been confounded with
another Sappho, of a different character; but we have no doubt
that her life was as pure as her poetry is charming. Her
imagery, when imagery she used, Sappho gathered from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
bright-tinted flowers, the starry skies, and fragrant zephyrs of
Lesbos, where, as she sung,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Through orchard plots, with fragrance crowned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The clear cold fountain murmuring flows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And forest leaves, with rustling sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Invite to soft repose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Judging from her fragments, we must admit that in her peculiar
department Sappho stands without a peer. Indeed, her
own graceful lines may well be applied to herself:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The stars that round the beauteous moon</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Attendant wait, cast into shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their ineffectual lustres, soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As she, in full-orbed majesty arrayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Her silver radiance showers</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Upon this world of ours,”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">for the lesser lights of lyric poesy pale in the lustre of her
genius.</p>

<p>Addison, in his Spectator, makes the following remarks on
Sappho, which are fully justified by the praises of ancient critics:—“Among
the mutilated poets of antiquity, there are none
whose fragments are so beautiful as those of Sappho. One
may see, by what is left, that she followed nature in all her
thoughts, without descending to those little points, conceits,
and turns of wit, with which many of our modern lyrics are so
miserably infected. Her soul seems to have been made up
of love and poetry. She felt the passion in all its warmth and
described it in all its symptoms. I do not know, by the character
that is given of her works, whether it is not for the benefit
of mankind that they are lost. They were filled with such
bewitching tenderness and rapture, that it might have been
dangerous to have given them a reading.”</p>

<p>It is told that a physician, by studying the symptoms of love
as described by Sappho, detected in the mysterious sickness
of the young Anti’ochus, son of the king of Syria, a hidden
passion for his step-mother. The treatment was in accord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>ance
with the diagnosis, the disease disappearing when the
anxious father relinquished to the youth the beautiful object
of his affections.</p>

<p>Sappho’s description of the raptures of love, commended by
all critics from Longinus down, is certainly a nonpareil. It
has been thus translated by Ambrose Philips, a friend of Addison’s:—</p>

<p>The grave Solon paid our authoress a delicate compliment.
Having heard his nephew recite one of her poems, he is said
to have exclaimed that he would not willingly die till he had
learned it by heart.</p>

<p>The works of Sappho, comprised in nine books, embraced
love-lays, elegies, bridal songs sometimes extended into miniature
dramas, and amorous hymns to Venus and Cupid. The
remnants are principally erotic pieces. We present below the
Hymn to Venus, preserved entire, in which the writer delicately
makes the goddess her confidante, and modestly discloses
the secret of her misplaced affections.</p>

<p><b>Sappho’s Pupils.</b>—Doubtless many went forth from Sappho’s
school to reflect, in their own accomplishments, the brilliancy
of their mistress. History has preserved the names of two of
her pupils—Damoph’yla of Asia Minor, noted for a Hymn to
Diana; and <span class="smcap">Erinna</span>, a Rhodian maid who shone among the
brightest lights of Sappho’s circle, and, if we may believe the
story, died of a broken heart when compelled by her parents
to exchange the delights of literature for the drudgery of the
spinning-wheel. This cruel treatment Erinna made the subject
of an affecting lament, “the Spindle,” a poem of three
hundred hexameters, on which her reputation rests. Her
death at the age of nineteen cheated the world of a writer
who promised to rival Homer himself.</p>

<p>“The Spindle” is lost; but the following epigram on a
virgin of Lesbos, who died on the day appointed for her
marriage, speaks for Erinna:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“The virgin Myrtis’ sepulchre am I;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Creep softly to the pillar’d mount of woe;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, Hymen! thou didst change the marriage-song</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the shrill wailing of the mourners’ throng.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A pointed epitaph in the Greek Anthology shows the estimation
in which the poetess was held by her countrymen:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“These are Erinna’s songs: how sweet, though slight!</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Had death delayed, whose fame had equalled hers?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><b>Anacreon.</b>—In the sixth century, Te’os, a seaport of Ionia,
gave birth to the society poet, Anacreon; who, though an
Ionian, wrote rather in the style of the Æolian lyrics. His
verses, however, while soft and graceful, were marked by levity,
and lacked the dignity and depth of the Æolic school.
“The Muse, good humor, love, and wine,” Anacreon tells us,
were his themes; accordingly his songs, brimming with sensuality,
grew in popular estimation as Greece degenerated in
public morality.</p>

<p>When his native city fell a prey to Cyrus the Persian, Anacreon
with the other inhabitants set sail for Thrace (540 B.C.).
From Thrace, while yet in his youth, he withdrew to the island
of Sa’mos whose tyrant, Polyc’rates, was a munificent patron
of literature and art. Amid the gayety of the Samian court,
the witty and pleasure-loving poet found a congenial home,
Polycrates making him an intimate companion and confiding
to him important state secrets. But the ruler of Samos was
treacherously put to death by a Persian satrap; about which
time, Anacreon was invited to Athens by the tyrant Hipparchus,
who sent his royal trireme to bring his poet-laureate
across the Ægean.</p>

<p>At Athens, Anacreon for a time gave free rein to his passions,
joining a set of boon companions who basked in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
sunshine of royal favor. His voluptuous career was cut short
by the assassination of Hipparchus, and he returned to Teos
(repeopled during his absence), to be choked by a grape-seed
at the advanced age of eighty-five—or, if we are to take the
story figuratively, to fall a victim to his irrepressible love of
the bottle.</p>

<p>A statue of a drunken old man on the Athenian acropolis
kept alive in the minds of the people as well the graceful odes
of Anacreon as his prevailing weakness. His friend Simonides
wrote an epitaph to his memory, in which we catch a
glimpse of the exciting whirl of pleasures that made up his
existence:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bland mother of the grape! all-gladdening vine!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Teeming inebriate joy! whose tendrils bloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crisp-woven in winding trail, now green entwine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This pillar’s top, this mount, Anacreon’s tomb.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As lover of the feast, the untempered bowl,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the full draught was reeling in his soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He smote upon the harp, whose melodies</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were tuned to girlish loves, till midnight fled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, fallen to earth, embower him as he lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy purpling clusters blushing o’er his head:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still be fresh dew upon the branches hung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like that which breathed from his enchanting tongue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The name of Anacreon is attached to about sixty odes, but
they are all probably from five hundred to a thousand years
later than he. Yet, if they are not by his hand, they breathe
his spirit. As a sample of these Anacreontics, we give a paraphrase

<p><b>Simonides</b> (556-467 B.C.), who brought into high repute the
Doric or Choral School while he also composed in the Ionic
dialect, was born in Ceos, an island of the Cyclades. He was
one of a brilliant coterie of poets attracted to Athens by the
munificence of Hipparchus; and after the assassination of
the latter he withdrew to Thessaly, to find rich and powerful
patrons there on whom to lavish his eulogies; for Simonides
was the first poet that set a price upon his talents and turned
his panegyrics into gold. He who, when small pay was offered,
disdained to celebrate a mule victorious in the race on
the plea that it was an ass’s daughter, when the price was
raised found in the “child of thunder-footed steeds” no unfit
subject for his facile Muse.</p>

<p>In connection with this rather unpoetical eye to business,
we are told that once Simonides, having extolled in verse one
of his Thessalian patrons, was refused more than half the
promised price and referred for the balance to the gods Castor
and Pollux, whose praises filled most of the poem. The Thessalian
noble was still laughing at his ruse for evading payment,
when Simonides was summoned from the room to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
with two strangers. Hastening out, he found that they had
vanished; but no sooner had he withdrawn from the apartment
than the roof fell and killed all whom he had left there.
Thus the twin deities discharged their indebtedness to the
poet.</p>

<p>The evening of his days Simonides passed in Syracuse,
the ornament of Hi’ero’s court, the recipient of royal favors
during his life, and at his death of the highest funeral honors.
It was here that the poet, who was somewhat of a philosopher,
confessed his inability to answer the question of the
Syracusan monarch, “What is God?”</p>

<p>Simonides was remarkably successful in adapting the elegy
to funeral songs and epitaphs, and thus embalming Grecian
heroism for the contemplation of future ages. He lived in
the time of the Persian War, and commemorated its worthies.
The tomb of the three hundred who fell at Thermopylæ for
the liberties of Greece bore this grand inscription from his
pen: “Go, stranger, and tell the Lacedæmonians that we lie
here in obedience to their laws.” In his workshop the epigram
was wrought to perfection. “The Simonidean tears" seemed
to well up from the very depths of the heart. Among all the
epigrammatists known to literature, none have excelled him
whom Plato styled “the divine Simonides;” who was “the
voice of Hellas—the genius of Fame, sculpturing with a pen
of adamant, in letters of indelible gold, the achievements to
which the whole world owes its civilization.” Fifty-six times,
the last time at the age of eighty, he bore away from all competitors
the prize of poetry.</p>

<p>Besides dirges and epigrams, hymns, prayers, pæans, and
processional odes, flowed from the prolific pen of Simonides.
Long a chorus-teacher in the land of his birth, he was peculiarly
fitted for the composition of solemn choral poetry.
“The Lament of Danaë,” his finest surviving work, is a noble
specimen of the Greek lyric. It describes the Argive princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
set adrift with her child in an ark upon the stormy billows by
her inhuman parent. Tenderly she folds the sleeping boy in
her arms, and prays Father Zeus that like him the sea may
sleep.</p>

<h4>MINOR ELEGIAC AND IAMBIC POETS.</h4>


<ul>
<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Mimnermus</span> of Colophon (634-590 B.C.),<br />
the first to adapt the elegiac couplet
to plaintive and erotic themes: he
bewails the enslavement of his degenerate
country by Lydia. Old age
the terror of the poet; life without
“the gold-haired goddess” of love
not worth living; a characteristic
saying of his, “When the flower of
youth is past, it is best to die at
once; may death strike me at my
sixtieth year.”</li>

<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Solon</span>, the Athenian lawgiver (638-559 B.C.),<br />
the first <i>gnomic</i> poet: embodied
his moral maxims (<i>gnomes</i>) in elegiac
verse: also a master of the martial
elegy, as his famous “Salaminian
Ode” shows. Plato declared that
if Solon had devoted his genius to
the Muses, Homer might not have
stood alone in his glory.</li>

<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Theognis</span> (583-495 B.C.),<br />
a noble of
Meg’ara, who opposed the democratic
faction, and was in consequence expelled
from the state and deprived of
his hereditary lands by the Commons.
He sang his songs in elegiac verse.
Distinguished also as a gnomic poet.
The following thoughts are culled
from among his sayings:—“Wealth
is almighty.”—“Easy among men is
the practice of wickedness, but hard
the method of goodness.”—“No one
descends to Hades with his riches,
nor can he by paying ransom escape
death.”—“Prefer to live piously on
small means to being rich on what
is gotten unjustly.”</li>

<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Phocyl’ides</span> of Miletus (550-490 B.C.),<br />
an Ionian gnomic poet whose didactic
couplets, generally marked by sound
sense, sometimes breathing a worldly
spirit, began with the introductory
phrase, “And this too is Phocylides’.”
The following are maxims of his:—“First
get your living, and then think
of getting virtue.”—“A small city set
upon a rock and well-governed is
better than all foolish Nineveh.”</li>

<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Xenoph’anes</span> of Colophon (about 540 B.C.),<br />
founder of the Eleatic sect of
philosophers: also an elegiac poet:
condemns the effeminacy of his countrymen,
and derides a prevailing preference
for physical over intellectual
culture.</li>

<h4>THE SATIRISTS.</h4>

<ul>
<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Simonides the Elder</span>, of Amorgus<br />

got one she becomes a plague.”</li>

<li class="hang"><span class="smcap">Hip’ponax</span> of Ephesus (540 B.C.),<br />
the father of parody, and inventor of the
choliambic measure, or limping iambic,
in which the last foot was a spondee.
He attacked the luxury and
vice of his day, sparing neither friend
nor relative; it is told that by his
crushing satire a sculptor who had
caricatured his ugly person was
driven to suicide. It was Hipponax
who said: “Woman gives two days
of happiness to man, the day of her
bridal and the day of her funeral.”

<small><i>RISE OF GREEK PROSE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Earliest Prose Writings.</b>—For several centuries, the literature
of Greece was confined to poetry. In Hellas, as elsewhere,
verse for a time at first so charmingly and completely
filled the popular ear that there was no desire, no room, for
prose. But, as new necessities arose, poetry could not suffice
for Greece; not with epic and lyric voice alone were her
men of genius to gain a hearing from the world. National
achievements must be recorded; the people must be appealed
to in the agora; the curtain of metaphysics must be
raised; and so History, Oratory, and Philosophy appeared
upon the stage. To these practical new-comers, the plain
garb of prose was found more appropriate than the broidery
of verse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, the introduction of facilities for writing favored
the development of prose literature; for, unlike poetry, it
needed a written form to give it permanence. When the art
of writing became familiar, and men with its help could rapidly
inscribe their thoughts for others still more rapidly to read,
prose, as a distinct branch of composition, was born; and its
birth marked an era in the intellectual growth of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Ever since the introduction of letters, prose had doubtless
been used more or less in despatches, records, laws, and official
documents. Pherecy’des of Sy’ros and Cadmus of Miletus
(about 550 B.C.) were the first to secure its recognition as a
department of polite literature, the one embodying in it his
philosophical doctrines, the other the fabulous history of his
native land—with homely strength, if not with artistic finish.</p>


<p><b>Era of the Sages.</b>—In the period during which prose gained
its first foothold flourished the Seven Sages of Greece (665-540
B.C.). Revolutions were then the order of the day, the
people were beginning actively to assert their rights, and political
questions of vital interest absorbed the attention of
thinkers. The flights of fancy became fewer, as these grave
problems presented themselves. Philosophers strove to solve
them at home; patriots went abroad to study foreign institutions;
and all awoke to the discovery that “knowledge is
power.”</p>

<p>The Seven Sages were gnomic poets, as well as philosophers
and statesmen. Their moral and political maxims
they usually threw into verse; but those inscribed on plates
of metal and deposited in the temple of Apollo at Delphi,
were in prose. In their proverbs, whether prose or poetry,
we discern the dawn of moral philosophy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Solon.</span>—The greatest of the Seven Sages were Solon and
Thales. Solon of Athens was born about 638 B.C. After
extensive travels and studies, he drew up for the Athenians
(594 B.C.) the famous code called by his name, which re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>formed
many abuses and secured to the people a liberal government.
His laws were written in prose on the polished
faces of triangular wooden
prisms. These were set
in frames, and turned on
pivots by persons who
wished to consult them.
The state copy was carved
on four-sided blocks of
brass, and kept in the Acropolis.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_p180" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_p180.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Solon’s Tablets.</span></div>
</div>

<p>After Solon’s code was adopted, that it might be the better
enforced, its author is said to have absented himself from
Athens for ten years, visiting among other courts that of
Crœsus, King of Lydia. To this visit, Crœsus owed his life;
for afterward, when chained to the stake by Cyrus the Persian,
the truth of one of Solon’s remarks,—that no man can be accounted
happy while he still lives,—flashed upon his mind,
and he thrice called upon the name of the Athenian sage.
Cyrus demanded an explanation of his words, and, struck
with the truth of Solon’s saying, revoked the order of execution
and made Crœsus his friend.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thales</span>, of Miletus in Ionia (640-550 B.C.), was the founder
of Greek philosophy. Water, according to his theory, was
the source of all things; without this element, he truly said,
his own body would fall into dust. This doctrine he is supposed
to have derived from the Egyptians, who worshipped
the Nile as a god, being dependent on its annual inundations
for their crops.</p>

<p>In mathematical science and astronomy, Thales was an
adept. His knowledge of the latter enabled him to predict a
solar eclipse, which took place 610 B.C., and to divide the
year into three hundred and sixty-five days. If he was an
author, not a line of what he wrote has survived.</p>

<p><b>Fable.</b>—An outgrowth of these practical times was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
Fable, or Allegory, in which the lower animals were introduced
as speakers, with the object of satirizing the follies of
mankind, or of conveying some useful moral more pointedly
than by means of dry argument.</p>

<p>Destitute of the outward form of poetry, while in a measure
retaining its imagery, fable may be regarded as a stepping-stone
from the early lyrics to the stately prose of a later
period. It at once became popular, as did also a kindred
class of humorous tales, the characters of which were inanimate
objects endowed with the power of speech. An earthen
pot, for example, is represented as clamoring loudly against
the woman who broke it; and she, as bidding it “cease its
plaints and show its wisdom by buying a copper ring to
bind itself together.”</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Æsop.</span>—The great fabulist of Greece, and indeed of all
time, was Æsop. Born a Phrygian slave about 620 B.C., he
passed from one master to another till at last his wit gained
him freedom. Thus left to choose his own course, he became
a student in foreign lands. Athens was his home for a number
of years; and there, in his well-known fable of “the Frogs
asking Jupiter for a King,” he read a lesson both to Pisistratus
the Tyrant and to the people who imagined themselves
oppressed under his government.</p>

<p>By special invitation, Æsop spent some time at the court
of Crœsus. Here he made the acquaintance of Solon, who
had incurred that monarch’s displeasure by speaking lightly
of his vaunted wealth; and he is said to have admonished
the Athenian sage that a wise man should resolve either not
to converse with kings at all, or to converse with them agreeably.”—“Nay,”
replied Solon, “he should either not converse
with them at all, or converse with them usefully.”</p>

<p>Crœsus commissioned Æsop to go to Delphi for the purpose
of sacrificing to Apollo and distributing a sum of money
among the citizens. But Æsop quarrelled with the Del<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>phians,
and taking it upon himself to withhold from them the
Lydian gold, was seized by the enraged people and hurled
from a precipice. Legend says that the murderers brought
upon themselves the vengeance of heaven in the form of
mysterious plagues.</p>

<p>While these particulars of Æsop’s life rest on rather dubious
authority, it is certain that as a fable-writer he was deservedly
appreciated in ancient Greece. At Athens, Æsop’s
Fables became indispensable to a polite education. Their
author does not appear to have committed them to writing;
they passed from mouth to mouth for generations, undergoing
more or less change. Hence we have left only the substance
of those pointed stories over which the Athenians went into
transports, and which Socrates amused himself by turning into
verse during his imprisonment. The young folks of every
age, with whom Æsop has always been a favorite, would
applaud the Athenians for placing the statue of the world’s
great fabulist before those of their Seven Sages.</p>

<p>When the people of Samos were on the point of executing
a public officer who had robbed the treasury, they were induced
to spare the offender by Æsop’s spicy fable of</p>


<p class="center">THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Fox, while crossing a river, was driven by the stream into a
narrow gorge, and lay there for a long time unable to get out, covered
with myriads of horse-flies that had fastened upon him. A
Hedgehog, who was wandering in that direction, saw him, and taking
compassion on him, asked if he should drive away the flies that
were so tormenting him. But the Fox begged him to do nothing of
the sort.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>“Because,” replied the Fox, “these flies that are upon me now are
already full, and draw but little blood; but should you remove them,
a swarm of fresh and hungry ones will come, who will not leave a
drop of blood in my body.”—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p>
</div>


<p><b>Progress of Greek Prose.</b>—An impetus was given to the
development of Greek prose by the praiseworthy efforts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Pisistratus (537-527 B.C.), who gathered the first library in
Greece, collected and edited the poems of Homer, and imitated
his kinsman Solon in laboring to elevate the literary
taste of the people. During his administration and that of
his sons Hippias and Hipparchus, also patrons of letters,
prose literature took deep root throughout the Ionian colonies,
where history and philosophy had many representatives.</p>

<p>The style of these early writers was for the most part fragmentary,
dry, and inelegant. It soon improved, however,
grew into favor, and in the hands of the profound thinkers,
fluent historians, and persuasive orators of Greece, was
wrought into models which are still the admiration of the
world.</p>

<small><i>GOLDEN AGE OF GRECIAN LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>

<p class="center"><small>(480-330 B.C.)</small></p>


<p><b>The Attic Period.</b>—In their wars with the Persians (492-479
B.C.), the Hellenic people fully demonstrated their military
superiority, vindicating their manhood on the fields of Marathon
and Platæa, and in the sea-fight with Xerxes at Salamis.
Under the stimulus of these national triumphs, conducing to
national unity, as well as of the free institutions now generally
established, the Greek mind was awakened to renewed action;
literature made unprecedented growth, and in the fifth century
B.C. matured its choicest products.</p>

<p>Athens, the laurel-crowned saviour of Greece, hitherto but
an indifferent contributor to art and poetry, now became the
centre of letters, aspiring through her statesman Pericles (469-429
B.C.) to both literary and political supremacy. Her At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>tic
dialect, nervous but not rough, harmonious without a too
effeminate softness—the perfection of the Greek language—materially
helped to make her the “mother of eloquence,” the
home of poets and philosophers, the school of the nations;
while Pericles extended her imperial dominion over many
cities and islands, and filled her coffers with their tribute. Her
sculptor Phidias devoted his genius to the erection and decoration
of public edifices; his grand creations in marble
adorned her fanes; and the Parthenon, whose classic beauty
has passed into a proverb, owed to him its graceful embellishments
as well as its renowned statue of Minerva. Another
colossal image of the goddess surmounted the Athenian
Acropolis, which was crowned with noble temples; and votaries
of the sister art added to the attractions of the city with
their brush and colors.</p>

<p>It was at this noonday of Attic glory that Grecian literature
reached its meridian. Then lyric verse climbed to heights
before unattained; and dramatic poetry, tragic and comic,
held its listeners spell-bound. History found distinguished
representatives in Herodotus the Ionian, and later in Thucydides
and Xenophon, the Athenians. Philosophy, in no other
age or clime, has had worthier teachers than Socrates, Plato,
and Aristotle; while the art of persuasion seemed to be impersonated
in Pericles, Isoc’rates, Æschines (<i>es’ke-neez</i>), Demosthenes—all
true sons of Attica.</p>


<h4>LYRIC POETRY.</h4>


<p><b>Pindar.</b>—Lyric poetry culminated in the sublime odes of
Pindar, who ushered in the golden age. Pindar was born of
noble parents about 520 B.C., near Thebes, a city of Bœotia.
The celestials are fabled to have danced at his birth, and the
dropping of honey on his infant lips by a swarm of bees was
interpreted as an omen of a brilliant literary career.</p>

<p>An early display of poetical talent led his father to yield to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
the boy’s desire and send him to Athens for instruction;
thence he returned to Thebes, to study under the direction of
the Bœotian poetesses, Myrtis and Corinna, who gave the finishing
touches to his education. At the age of twenty, he
composed an ode which established his reputation throughout
Greece, and brought him into great request with princes and
heroes who craved immortality for victories at the national
games. Corinna was the rival of his youth; though she reproached
Myrtis for entering the lists against Pindar, she was
herself tempted to contend with her former pupil, and five
times bore away from him the fillet of victory.</p>

<p>Pindar made choral poetry his profession, and was handsomely
paid out of the treasuries of the Greek princes and free
cities for laudatory odes written to their order. But he never
descended to flattery or falsehood; on the contrary, he leavened
his panegyrics with salutary advice, and fearlessly denounced
pride, cupidity, and tyranny, even in monarchs. To
the king of Cyrene, for example, whose tyranny afterward cost
him his throne, he said: “It is easy for a fool to shake the
stability of a city, but it is hard to place it again on its foundations.”</p>

<p>Pindar’s home was at Thebes, near Dirce’s fountain;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but
he travelled much in Greece. For a time he was the honored
guest of the Athenians; and no wonder, for when his native
city sided with Persia in the deadly struggle with that empire,
the poet condemned so pusillanimous a course and upheld
Athens in her resistance, styling her “the Pillar of Greece.”
It is told that he received from the Athenians a gift of 10,000
drachmas ($1,800), and that when the Thebans mulcted him
for the bold expression of his views, the former generously
paid the fine. At Delphi, which Pindar often visited, the people
contributed their finest fruits for his entertainment by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
order of the priestess; and an iron chair was set apart for
his use in the temple, where he was wont to sit and sing the
praises of Apollo, god of poetry. He lived four years with
Hiero, and doubtless sojourned with others of his patrons.
But Pindar was no boon companion of kings like Simonides,
and while he accepted their costly presents he never forfeited
the respect of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Pindar died at the age of eighty, in the theatre, it is related,
amid the acclamations of the audience. He had been taking
part as usual, and overcome with weariness, rested his head
on the knees of a favorite pupil, and fell into a slumber from
which his friends vainly strove to wake him. A tradition,
more in accordance with the Greek love of the marvellous, informs
us that a few days before he died Proserpine (goddess
of the lower world) appeared to him, and having reproached
him for slighting her in his odes, announced that he should
soon compose a song in her honor within the confines of her
own kingdom. Shortly after, Pindar’s death occurred; and
on the following day, Thebes resounded with a hymn to Proserpine
sung by an old woman, who declared the poet’s ghost
had dictated it to her in a dream.</p>

<p>Statues were erected to Pindar at Athens and in the hippodrome
of Thebes; a hundred years after, when Alexander the
Great destroyed the latter city in consequence of its rebellion,
he bade his soldiers spare the house hallowed by having once
been the residence of the Theban bard. Statues and dwelling
have since passed away, and the only surviving monument of
Pindar is that reared by himself in the deathless odes he has
left us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pindaric Ode.</span>—Pindar’s fertile pen enriched every
department of lyric poetry; but all his compositions are lost
except a few fragments of pæans and dirges, with forty-five
Triumphal Odes (which we have entire) written to commemorate
victories at the Great Games of Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>These games were celebrated at Olympia, Delphi, Neme’a,
and on the Corinthian Isthmus: they consisted of athletic
sports, races, literary and musical contests. All Greece was
represented at them. Peasant and prince, trader and priest,
poet and historian, painter and sculptor, hurried to the exciting
scene as contestants or spectators; and the simple crown of
olive or laurel, pine or parsley, that was placed on the conqueror’s
brow, was valued beyond price. All that was needed
to complete the triumph was an ode in its honor from the
Great Lyrist. This, when obtained, was sung at an honorary
banquet or solemn procession, amid great rejoicings; and was
annually rehearsed in the victor’s native town to the accompaniment
of soul-stirring music—for his family, town, and state,
participated in the victor’s glory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pindar’s Style</span> is original, chaste, full of splendor and
majestic energy. The Theban eagle, as he has often been
called, soaring to the sun, seems to disdain the commonplace
in his solitary flight. His style, however, is not faultless. The
over-boldness of his metaphors confuses; his massing of magnificent
images and high-sounding epithets wearies; his Doric
condensation obscures his meaning; his metre is too complicated
for the uneducated ear, and his transitions are so abrupt
that the reader has difficulty in finding the connection. His
subjects were hard to treat; but Pindar found material and
lent variety to his odes by skilfully interweaving legendary
lore, history, and fragments of mythology. This was by Corinna’s
advice; but her young pupil carried it to such excess
in his first attempt that his fair teacher warned him, “One
should sow with the hand, not with the whole sack.”</p>

<p>Pindar’s tone is everywhere moral. He merits indeed the
title of “Sacerdotal Poet;” for he upheld the religion of
Greece in its purity, rejecting all sensual notions of “the
blessed ones,” and asserting his faith in their holiness and
justice. He taught the immortality of the soul; “things of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
a day” are men, but after death there is in store “a gladsome
life.” His belief in an existence beyond the grave is indicated
in the following lines from one of his dirges. And here be it
observed that no translation can do justice to Pindar; the
Doric diamonds cease to flash when removed from their Doric
setting.</p>

<p>The more characteristic extract given below consists of
portions of the Seventh Olympic Ode, in which the poet sings
the praises of Diag’oras of Rhodes for having gained a victory
with the cestus (made of leather thongs and worn round the
hands in boxing). This ode was so much admired by the
Rhodians that they wrote it in golden letters on the wall of
Minerva’s temple at Lindus. It relates the birth of their
patron goddess and the story of their own origin, closing with
an invocation to Jupiter, who was worshipped on Ataby’ris, a
mountain of the island. Here stood a temple, dedicated to
him, containing the fabulous brazen bulls that bellowed when
any calamity threatened.</p>

<p><b>Antimachus.</b>—An elegiac poet of the golden age was Amtim’achus
of Col’ophon, whose “Ly’de,” an elegy on his lost
love, enjoyed considerable celebrity. When, however, Antim’achus
undertook to read his long “Theba’is” to an audience,
their patience became exhausted and one after another departed,
until finally he had but a single listener left,—the
young Plato.</p>


<h4>DRAMATIC POETRY.</h4>

<p><b>Rise of the Attic Drama.</b>—The Greek drama, like the Hindoo,
had a religious origin. In the festivals of Bacchus, the
wine-god, which consisted of licentious dances and songs round
his altar by persons disguised in goat-skins as fauns and satyrs
(beings half-man and half-goat), we must look for its earliest
phase. From the dress of those who composed the chorus,
or because a goat was sacrificed, or a goat-skin of wine awarded
to the poet who wrote the best ode for the occasion, such
ode was called a <i>tragedy</i> (<i>goat-song</i>); and the name was afterward
extended to the entire department of dramatic poetry to
which these rude hymns gave rise.</p>

<p>Comedy, on the contrary, was elaborated from the <i>village-songs</i>
rife during the gala-days of the vintage, when companies
of noisy revellers (in Greek, <i>kōmoi</i>), their cheeks stained with
wine-lees, went about from town to town, plunging into all
kinds of excesses, and garnishing their songs with jokes at
the expense of the spectators.</p>

<p>The Father of Greek tragedy was <span class="smcap">Thespis</span>, the Icarian,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
who refined the coarse Bacchanalian orgies, and introduced a
single actor (generally sustaining the part himself), to alternate
with the chorus or enter into a dialogue with its leaders
(536 B.C.). Between the hymns, the poet, having smeared his
face with paint, would mount a table and recite with copious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
gestures some mythological legend, perhaps relating to Bacchus.</p>

<p>With a trained chorus, Thespis strolled about Greece, stopping
at the towns to give his exhibitions on the wagon which
carried his machinery and skin-clad troupe. Dancing was a
prominent feature of his entertainments. His pupil Phryn’icus
improved the performance by exchanging myths for real
events and introducing female characters; but the recitations
were still disconnected and the plays lacked method; albeit
Phryn’icus was fined by the Athenians for moving their feelings
too deeply by one of his pieces.</p>

<p><b>Birth of Tragedy.</b>—Out of these rude materials, Æschylus,
who was born about ten years after the first Thespian exhibition,
constructed genuine tragedy. He added a second actor
and remodelled the chorus, making it secondary to the dialogue,
and instituting a connection between its songs and the
events represented on the stage. Appropriate theatrical costumes,
stationary scenery, painted masks, and thick-soled buskins
to increase the height of the performers, complete the
list of his innovations. Thus the goat-song of early days developed
into the true drama (<i>action</i>), the crowning effort of
Greek genius. Athens had the honor of creating and perfecting
it; while in other departments of verse she fell behind
her neighbors, in dramatic poetry she eclipsed them all.</p>

<p>The love of the theatre grew into a passion at Athens.
When the first rude structure of boards gave way under the
weight of the audience, her citizens erected a permanent edifice
of semicircular form, whose seats, rising in tiers, were
hewn in the rocky side of the Acropolis. This new theatre
accommodated thirty thousand persons, who sat under the
shadow of Athens’ patron-goddess, and with reverent gaze
watched actors and chorus go through their parts round the
altar of Bacchus.</p>

<p>The performances took place by day, and in the open air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the theatre not being roofed. They began immediately after
the morning meal, and on great occasions seats were secured
and occupied during the preceding night. It was the custom
of those who desired a comfortable sitting to bring their own
cushions. Tickets of admission at first cost one drachma
(18 cents); but Pericles reduced the price to six cents, and
thus placed dramatic entertainments within the reach of the
poorest citizens. The audience sometimes remained in the
theatre twelve hours, gossiping during the intervals, and refreshing
themselves with cake, wine, and sweetmeats.—In ancient
Greece, the actor’s profession was lucrative and honorable;
dramatic authors not unfrequently performed parts in
their own plays. (<i>Read Donaldson’s “Theatre of the Greeks.”</i>)</p>

<p>Under the favoring skies of Athens the drama advanced to
perfection with marvellous rapidity. In the hands of Æschylus
it was all grandeur; Sophocles invested it with beauty,
and Euripides with pathos. These three tragic poets, almost
contemporaries, were the brightest ornaments of the Attic capital,
where there were many bright. Their triumphs cover a
period of seventy-eight years (484-406 B.C.), including the
proud age of Pericles, but extending beyond it till the Peloponnesian
War had deprived Athens of her supremacy. Simultaneously
with Sophocles and Euripides flourished Aristophanes,
under whom comedy reached its climax.</p>

<p>It has been computed that during the golden age 250 dramatic
poets flourished, who produced more than 3,400 plays.
Out of this vast number, only 44 have survived to our time.</p>


<p><b>Æschylus</b> (525-456 B.C.).—Eleusis, a hamlet of Attica, was
the birthplace of Æschylus. It is related that in his youth he
was charged with watching grapes, and overcome by slumber,
saw Bacchus in his dreams, who bade him devote himself to
tragedy. The boy forgot not the injunction; he applied himself
diligently to study, and in his twenty-fifth year contended,
though unsuccessfully, for the chaplet of ivy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Ten years afterward, he acquitted himself so bravely in the
battle of Marathon as to receive a special prize, and have his
deeds immortalized in a painting which was hung in the theatre
at Athens. He also won distinction at Salamis and Platæa;
and the name of one of his brothers was long remembered
in connection with the sinking of the Persian admiral’s
galley. During the flourishing period of Athenian history
that followed, the literary reputation of Æschylus became as
great as his military renown. He was the hero of thirteen
poetical victories.</p>

<p>In 468 B.C. Æschylus left Athens for the court of Hiero,
the Syracusan prince, round which so many great men clustered.
According to some, the unjust award of the tragic
prize to Sophocles, for political reasons, was the cause of his
going. The more probable account is that his exile followed
a public accusation of impiety, for disclosing certain religious
mysteries in one of his plays. The popular excitement ran
high; the poet was attacked with stones, when his brother
happily averted the fury of the mob by uncovering before them
the stump of his own arm, which had been mutilated at Salamis
in defence of his country.</p>

<p>Hiero received our author hospitably; and the poet made
return by writing for him a drama called “the Women of
Etna.” Æschylus may have visited Athens after this; but
if so, he returned to Sicily to die, in the sixty-ninth year of
his age. While he sat in a field near Gela absorbed in
thought, so the fable goes, an eagle, hovering over the spot
with a tortoise in its talons, let the tortoise fall on his bald
crown, which it mistook for a shining cobble-stone, for the
purpose of breaking the shell. The bird’s aim was true;
and the blow fractured the poet’s skull. Thus, in fulfilment
of an oracular prediction, Æschylus received his death-stroke
from heaven.</p>

<p>In sublimity and power of dealing with the terrible, Æschylus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
is unequalled. Even the resources of the versatile Greek
tongue were hardly adequate to the expression of his conceptions.
He found congenial subjects only among the
gods and demigods of mythology or the tragical events of
the heroic period. His genius enabled him to give life
and shape to the vast and the supernatural, as few others
have done—and most effectively, though his plot is always
simple.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott thus speaks of Æschylus in his Essay
on the Drama:—“At his summons, the mysterious and
tremendous volume of destiny, in which are inscribed the
dooms of gods and men, seemed to display its leaves of iron
before the appalled spectators; the more than mortal voices
of deities, Titans, and departed heroes, were heard in awful
conference; Olympus bowed, and its divinities descended;
earth yawned, and gave up the pale spectres of the dead;
and the yet more undefined and grisly forms of those infernal
deities who struck horror into the gods themselves.
All this could only be dared and done by a poet of the
highest order.”</p>

<p>But seven of the seventy-five tragedies of Æschylus are
extant. Of these, “Prometheus Chained” is considered the
greatest, and from it we have selected our extracts. The
opening scene is laid on the grim ocean’s shore near frowning
Caucasus, to which, in obedience to Jove’s command,
the giant Prometheus is to be chained. For thirty thousand
years a vulture is to tear his vitals, constantly growing out
afresh, as a punishment for his having given fire to mortals,
and taught them useful arts in opposition to the will of
heaven. Strength and Force, grandly personified, drag the
victim to the place of torture; and Vulcan, the god of fire,
rivets his fetters to the rock. The chorus is composed of
sea-nymphs, who come to offer their sympathy to the sufferer
and advise him to submit; but Prometheus, who is the em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>bodiment
of stern independence, fortitude, and decision, endures
unyieldingly to the last. Even amid “the thunder’s
deepening roar, blazing wreaths of lightning, and eddying
sands whirled on high,” while the earth rocks to its centre,
and “boisterous billows rise, confounding sea and sky,” he
hurls a proud defiance at his oppressors.</p>

<p>Prometheus may be regarded as typifying the spirit of
progress, bound by the shackles of inevitable destiny, chafing
under its enslavement, but enduring contumely and suffering
rather than yield to tyranny. The weird wail of Io on
leaving Prometheus, wrung from her by the persecution of
Juno, is thus rendered by Mrs. Browning, with all the wildness
and fire of the original:—</p>

<p><small>The three tragedies last named constitute what is called a <i>trilogy</i>, or group of
three dramas founded upon one story. “Prometheus Chained” was one of a
trilogy, of which the other two members are lost.</small></p>



<p><b>Sophocles</b> (495-405 B.C.), the rival of Æschylus, was born
at Colo’nus, an Attic borough a short mile from the capital.
He was fortunate in having a father able to give him a liberal
education, and entered the service of the Muses at an early
age. His skill in music and the exercises of the gymnasium
won him many a garland; and when hardly sixteen, unrobed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
and crowned, he led the choir of boys with his ivory lyre in
the chant of triumph which the Athenians poured forth round
the trophy raised at Salamis.</p>

<p>Sophocles made his début as a tragic writer in that successful
contest with Æschylus which, some think, cost Athens her
grand old dramatist. Fame spread the news, and Greece
looked to Sophocles as the coming man. A succession of
plays extended his popularity. He added nineteen prizes to
the one wrested from Æschylus in 468 B.C. In the year 440
he completed the drama of “Antig’one,” the oldest of his
seven surviving tragedies, which secured for him an important
official position. The “Antigone” ushered in the most
active portion of its author’s literary life, during which eighty-one
of his pieces were written. Although history throws little
light on this period of his career, we know that, unlike his
great contemporaries, he never left his native city to enjoy
the munificence of foreign patrons. The Greek theatre was
indebted to him for a third actor, improvements in scenery,
and a further modification of the chorus, which no longer
took an active part in the play.</p>

<p>In his eightieth year, Sophocles was charged with imbecility
by an ungrateful son, who regarded with jealous eyes his
partiality for a favorite grandchild, and hoped in this way to
obtain control of his property. The defence of the alleged
dotard was to read before his judges a choral song from a play
which he had just finished—“Œdipus at Colonus” (p. 206).
The vindication was complete; the judges at once rendered a
decision in the old poet’s favor, and in a burst of enthusiasm
bore him home in triumph. He died at the age of ninety.
Some tell us that while he was repeating the pathetic plaints
of his “Antigone,” his breath suddenly ceased; others, that
after gaining a tragic victory, he died of excessive joy as the
crown was placed on his brow. He left the Athenians 113
dramas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Style of Sophocles.</span>—As Æschylus is the impersonation
of grandeur, so is Sophocles of beauty and harmony. He descends
from the sublime heights Æschylus loved to tread, and,
appealing to our sympathy with humanity, finds his way into
the secret chambers of the heart. His language is pure; his
style, elegant, dignified, vivacious—faultless; in allusion to his
sweet diction, he was called by the ancients <i>the Bee of Attica</i>.
The type of manly beauty and intellectual power, æsthetic
culture and lofty morality, it seems as if Sophocles had been
“specially created to represent Greek art in its most refined
and exquisitely balanced perfection.”</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Masterpiece of Sophocles</span> is “King Œdipus.” Laïus,
a Theban monarch, told by an oracle (such was the legend)
that his children would be the cause of his death, had his infant
son Œdipus exposed on Mount Cithæron, hoping thus to
escape his destiny. But the boy was discovered by some
herdsmen and carried to Corinth, where he grew to man’s
estate as the adopted son and heir of the king.</p>

<p>Warned at the Delphic shrine to beware of his native land
lest he should imbrue his hands in his father’s blood, and believing
Corinth to be his birthplace, he withdrew to Thebes;
but on the way he met Laïus, and, not knowing who he was,
killed him in a quarrel. Arrived at Thebes, he won the hand
of the widow Jocasta, his own mother, who bore him four children.
All went well for a time. At length, however, an epidemic
broke out; and the oracle assigned as its cause the
presence of the late king’s murderer. Œdipus strained every
nerve to discover the offender, and at last, to his horror, fastened
the crime, and the more terrible guilt of parricide, upon
himself. Unhappy Jocasta hanged herself in the palace, and
Œdipus in his frenzy beat out his eyes with her gold-embossed
buckles.</p>

<p>The play opens at Thebes, during the plague. Œdipus, in
conversation with a priest and Creon, Jocasta’s brother, is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>formed
of Apollo’s will,—that, to avert the evil, the land must
be purified by the punishment of the assassin. After the
catastrophe above related, blinded Œdipus bemoans his lot in
heart-rending utterances, but finally accepts his fate with resignation.

<p>Œdipus ended his days in exile at Colonus, where he was
received by Theseus, the hero of Attica, and attended to the
last by his faithful daughter Antigone. His death is the
subject of the play “Œdipus at Colonus,” written at the
close of the poet’s life and reflecting the gentleness and serenity
of his last days. It contains one of the gems of Sophocles—that
chorus which has immortalized the lovely scenery
about Colonus—which the old poet recited before the
Athenian judges to prove his sanity. Bulwer furnishes us
a spirited version of this famous passage:—The chorus informs
the outcast Œdipus that he has come to Colonus,</p>

<p><b>Euripides.</b>—In 480 B.C., on the island of Salamis, while
the battle that was to decide the future of Greece raged
in the neighboring waters, Euripides first saw the light.
Æschylus, in his prime, was at the time bravely fighting on
an Athenian galley; while Sophocles, but fifteen years of
age, stood ready, should the gods grant his countrymen success,
to celebrate the victory with the arts in which he excelled.</p>

<p>The third of the illustrious tragic trio was carefully trained;
painting, rhetoric, and philosophy, besides the customary
gymnastic exercises, engaged his attention; and he had not
attained his eighteenth year when he finished his first drama.
Not, however, until 441 B.C. did he, by winning the tragic
prize, verify a prediction made before his birth that he would
be crowned with sacred chaplets.</p>

<p>His reputation was now secure; and though he was exposed
to bitter partisan attacks, his plays became widely
popular. The philosopher Socrates always went to see them
performed, and is even suspected of having had a hand in
their composition. So great was the estimation in which
they were held at Syracuse, that, after the surrender of the
Athenian armies which had attempted the reduction of that
city (413 B.C.), such of the soldiers as could teach their
captors verses of Euripides were exempted from the cruelties
inflicted on their fellows, and sent home to thank the
author for their liberty. Athens itself is said to have been
saved nine years later, when the Spartan general Lysander
was minded to lay it in ashes, by the singing of a chorus
of Euripides at the triumphal banquet; who could raise his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
hand against the city of one that had discoursed poetry so
sweet?</p>

<p>Like his brother tragedians, Euripides drew his subjects
from the mythical history of his country. His plays numbered
seventy-five, some say ninety-two; and the best of
them rank with the best pieces on the roll of dramatic
literature. He composed slowly and with care. On one
occasion, it is related, when he had completed only four
verses in three days, Euripides was told by a poetaster that
in the same time <i>he</i> had produced a hundred. “And yours,”
replied the great man, “will live for three days; mine, forever.”</p>

<p>Euripides spent the last two years of his life at the Macedonian
court, then the abode of many illustrious men. He
went there in search of rest, but found that he had only exchanged
persecution at home for jealousy abroad. The
honors heaped upon him by the Macedonian prince, together
with his own superior genius, raised him up enemies. In
the king’s savage hounds, if we may credit the legend, they
saw the means of removing an obnoxious rival; and while
Euripides was walking in his patron’s garden, he was attacked
and fatally mangled by the fierce brutes (406 B.C.).</p>

<p>Athens felt the loss, and went into mourning at news of
his death; vainly she supplicated the Macedonian king for
his ashes. They were magnificently interred at Pella; while
his country was forced to remain content with a statue, and
a cenotaph on which was inscribed, “All Greece is the
monument of Euripides.” His verses, as he predicted, were
immortal; admiration of them led an epigrammatist to write:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If it be true that in the grave the dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have sense and knowledge, as some men have said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I’d hang myself to see Euripides.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With Euripides, the glory of the Athenian stage descended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
into the tomb; and Tragedy found no one worthy to fill his
place till Shakespeare’s day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Style of Euripides.</span>—Sophocles once remarked that he
represented men as they ought to be, Euripides as they are.
This holding of the mirror up to nature was what Athenian
taste began to demand; Euripides had the tact to see what
was wanted, and the genius to make the innovation successfully.
His heroes and heroines talked and acted like men
and women of the day; hence he has been accused of degrading
his art by introducing the commonplace into his
dramas, of lowering Greek tragedy to the level of every-day
life.</p>

<p>A more serious charge also was laid at his door—that of
impiety. Euripides rejected the faith of his fathers; we
need not, therefore, look in his plays for the religious fervor
of Æschylus, or even for the high moral tone of Sophocles.
In one of his lines the doctrine of mental reservation appears,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My tongue took an oath, but my mind is unsworn”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">a sentiment which led to his prosecution for justifying perjury.</p>

<p>While Euripides was inferior to Æschylus in majesty, to
Sophocles in symmetry and finish, he surpassed both in delineating
character, and particularly in representing the human
passions. He was the most pathetic of the three, and
in the portraiture of woman stands second to no poet, ancient
or modern. His heroines are his master-figures.
Traces of art are sometimes apparent in his writings, and
occasionally he verges on the sensational.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Mede’a</span> is the <i>chef d’œuvre</i> of this author. Its plot
is derived from the story of Medea, a Colchian princess proficient
in sorcery. She won the love of the Greek prince
Jason, who came to Colchis in the ship Argo to obtain pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>session
of the Golden Fleece, helped him to secure the object
of his search, and eloped with him to Greece. But when
Jason beheld the fair Glaucè, daughter of the King of Corinth,
he resolved to thrust aside Medea in favor of his new
love, forgetful of the dark power of the enchantress.</p>

<p>The opening scene is laid at Corinth, after the nuptials of
Jason and Glaucè. The infidelity of her husband has transformed
Medea into a tigress, whose conflicting passions the
poet touches with consummate skill—the anger of the dishonored
wife, the love of the tender mother, the steeling of
the woman’s heart against its deep affection, the all-absorbing
thirst for vengeance.</p>

<p>The play ends with Medea’s terrible revenge. Banished
by the king from Corinth, she begs for one day of preparation,
in which she sends to the bride a costly robe and golden
wreath poisoned by her fell arts. The unsuspecting Glaucè
smilingly arrays herself in these presents; but her smiles
give place to shrieks of agony as the enchanted garments
burn into her flesh and the chaplet blazes in her hair. Her
father tries to save her, and perishes in her flaming embrace.
Medea completes her work by the murder of her two children—Jason’s
sons—and after jeering at her husband’s grief
disappears with the corpses in a chariot whirled through the
air by dragons.</p>

<p><b>Lost Tragedies.</b>—Dramatic literature has sustained an irreparable
loss, not only in the missing plays of the three
great masters, but also in those numberless works of their
contemporaries and occasionally successful competitors now
buried in oblivion. From the allusions of two or three Greek
authors, a few meagre particulars may be gleaned, now of
one, now of another—but they only serve to make us more
painfully conscious of our loss.</p>


<p><b>Greek Comedy.</b>—Comedy was older than tragedy in Greece.
Thirty years before the time of Thespis, Susa’rion of Meg’ara,
in his burlesque exhibitions, improved somewhat on the extempore
jests and village-songs of the Bacchic revellers, and
hence has been called the inventor of comedy. Susarion
was no great lover of the fair sex, if we may judge by an ungallant
sentiment of his which has been preserved: “Woman
is a curse, but we cannot conduct our household affairs without
this curse; therefore to marry is an evil, and not to marry
is an evil.” Perhaps he had taken to wife a Xantippe.</p>

<p>The poet Epicharmus, also of Megara, but the Sicilian city
of that name, first committed his effusions to writing; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the author of thirty-five comedies, some of them on subjects
not mythological.</p>

<p>The development of comedy, however, was interrupted.
The Tragic Muse enforced her claims at the expense of her
elder sister, and the latter was for a season neglected. But
the flourishing era of republican Athens, when the poet was
free to lash whom he chose, saw comedy restored to the favor
of the satire-loving people. It may be said to have been
perfected by Aristophanes. He not only ridiculed the follies
and vices of the day, laid bare family secrets on the stage,
and edified his audiences by caricaturing the rich and great
with masks and costumes which reproduced their peculiarities,
but fearlessly assailed the government. When all others
shrunk from playing so dangerous a rôle, he himself performed
the part of the insolent demagogue Cleon (originally
a leather-dresser), whom he mercilessly “cut into sandal-strips”
in his “Knights.”</p>

<p>Even the gods were not slighted by the comic poets. The
gourmand Hercules devours as fast as the cook can prepare
victuals; Prometheus is protected from the elements by an
umbrella; Bacchus swaggers as a fop and coward. Comedy
in the hands of Aristophanes and his contemporaries was to
the Athenians what our press is to us, but went still further.
Always personal and sometimes scurrilous in its attacks, too
often coarse and licentious in its tone, it yet doubtless accomplished
much good in restraining political ambition,
checking public corruption, and modifying the prevailing
faults of society.</p>


<p><b>Aristophanes.</b>—The oldest comedies extant are those of
Aristophanes, a citizen of Athens by birth or adoption, born
about the middle of the fifth century B.C. If he was an
adopted son, Athens had good reason to be proud of her protégé.
His society was sought by the learned and great. He
became the idol of the people, who fined such as brought libel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>suits
against him, and voted him an olive crown for exposing
the misconduct of their rulers.</p>

<p>Nor was his fame confined to Athens. All Greece, and
Sicily too, laughed at his humorous sallies. The Persian king
enjoyed his pungent satires, and regarded him as such a power
in Greece that when Spartan ambassadors sought an alliance
with Persia against their Athenian rivals, the king asked
on which side the comic poet was arrayed; for, said he, “the
party whose cause Aristophanes espouses will certainly win.”</p>

<p>Aristophanes was loyal to the true interests of his country,
and declined the flattering invitations of Dionysius to dwell
in ease at Syracuse with the luminaries of his age. He longed
for the glorious Athens of the past, and attacked whatever
conflicted with his conservative ideas. None escaped his
well-aimed shafts. He was specially severe on the Sophists,
a new class of teachers at Athens, whose forte lay in chopping
logic and splitting hairs, and who taught the tricks of rhetoric
rather than practical morality. In his “Clouds” he derides
their sharp practices and unsound system of education, striking
them over the head of Socrates, the exponent of true philosophy,
whose life was devoted to combating the false teachings
of these very pretenders.</p>

<p>That Socrates was merely the scape-goat is plain, for he and
Aristophanes were intimate friends. When the play was first
exhibited, the philosopher, who was in the audience, took it
all in good part, and even rose that the people might compare
him with the caricature presented, which exaggerated his eccentricities
of dress and figure—his pug-nose, thick lips, shabby
garments, and absent-minded stare. The chorus of changing
clouds symbolized the meretricious charms of sophistry.</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">The Clouds</span>” opens in the sleeping-apartment of Strepsi’ades,
an Athenian citizen, his son Pheidippides occupying
a pallet near him. The slaves of the household are abed in
an adjoining room. Strepsiades, oppressed by debt incurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
through the extravagance of his “precious son,” a fast young
man addicted to fast horses, is disturbed by the recollection
of numerous outstanding bills and notes about to mature.
He wakes before daylight and calls a slave:—</p>

<p>Failing to induce his son to enter the Thinking-school,
Strepsiades resolves himself to master the fashionable Argument
that “pays no bills;” he has an interview with Socrates,
and is introduced to the Clouds, the new goddesses of this
misty philosophy.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful passages of the play—having the
ring of the true metal—is the chorus of Clouds responding to
the call of Socrates—first, behind the scenes, in the distance;
then nearer; then rising from the lips of twenty-four gauze-clad
nymphs, who descend upon the stage as personifications
of the ethereal deities.</p>

<p>But though the Clouds assist Socrates in teaching Strepsiades,
the pupil proves an utter dunce. Finally, in a moment
of impatience, Socrates kicks him out of the school.</p>

<p>At last Pheidippides is prevailed upon to study with the
Sophists. He proves an apt scholar, rapidly developing into
an unprincipled scamp. When his education as a sharper is
completed, he brings to bear his specious arguments against
the creditors, and cheats them out of their dues. So far, so
good; but his notions of filial duty have also been greatly
modified by the instructions of Socrates. A quarrel arising
in the family, he hesitates not to fall upon his father with a
cudgel, and threatens to do the same by his mother if she
provokes him.</p>

<p>With a curse upon Socrates, the outraged old gentleman
calls his slaves, hurries to the Thinking-school, and sets fire
to the building. Thus the play ends.</p>

<p>Beneath the pleasantry of Aristophanes is a substratum of
solid sense; as is apparent in “the Birds,” an ingenious play
in which the woodland songsters take characters. It was pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>duced
at a time when the Athenians, puffed up with vanity,
confidently looked for the reduction of Sicily and the dominion
of Greece. Aristophanes alone, at this critical period,
ventured to raise the note of warning, and satirize their foolish
ambition. The choruses in this drama ring with the sweet
music of the wild woods; they were rendered by twenty-four
performers plumed so as to represent as many different kinds
of birds. The Hoopoe thus calls his fellows to a mass-meeting:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Style of Aristophanes.</span>—In weighing the merits of Aristophanes,
it must be remembered that many of his peculiar
beauties cannot be translated, and that we lose his local hits
from our inability to see things from an Athenian standpoint.
He is often indelicate in his allusions; he is as ready with
town slang and the cant of the shop as with the most elegant
phrase. But Attic salt seasons the whole, and none ever handled
the versatile Greek tongue more deftly. In his command
of language, he is equalled only by Plato, who felt the comic
poet’s power when he said that in the soul of Aristophanes
the Graces sought an imperishable shrine. Amid all his
humor and buffoonery sparkles genius of the highest order.
His aim seems to have been to elevate his art. Some of the
improvements he claimed to have introduced, are thus set
forth in an address which he puts into the mouth of the
leader of the chorus in his “Peace:”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“It was he that indignantly swept from the stage the paltry ignoble device</div>

<p>Aristophanes outlived the license of the old comedy, which
died with liberty. When in 404 B.C. the popular government
was overthrown, and Thirty Tyrants, supported by Sparta,
lorded it over Athens, a statute was passed making personal
attacks on the stage capital offences; an actor who defied the
law was actually starved to death. Thenceforth the comic
poet dared not individualize the object of his satire; he tilted
against vice and folly in general, or thrust at his intended
victims indirectly under assumed names.</p>

<p>Aristophanes died about 380 B.C. No other comic poet
could vie with him during his lifetime; none worthy to be his
successor arose after his death, for “Nature broke the mould
in which he was cast.” Of fifty-four comedies from his pen,
eleven remain entire.</p>

<h4>HISTORY.</h4>

<p>During this halcyon age of Greek poetry, prose also was
cultivated, and in the century following the Persian Wars it
was brought to maturity. After the victories that secured her
freedom, Greece felt the need of a national historian to record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the story of her struggles and triumphs. The earliest narrators,
as has been shown, confined themselves to mythology
and tradition: the times now demanded an artist who could
paint with faithful pencil on living canvas those scenes that
were the glory of Hellas—and in Herodotus of Halicarnassus
that artist appeared.</p>


<p><b>Herodotus</b> (born 484 B.C.).—Halicarnassus was the capital
of a Dorian confederacy of states in southern Asia Minor.
Its queen Artemisia supported Xerxes in his quarrel with
Greece; and although the Athenians, provoked that a woman
should take the field against them, offered an immense reward
for her capture, she escaped the perils of war, and carried
her kingdom safely through the political troubles of the time.</p>

<p>The parents of Herodotus were persons of rank and property.
His writings prove him to have been well read in the
literature of his country. Though not an Ionian born, he
adopted the Ionic dialect—the dress in which Greek prose
first appeared.</p>

<p>Herodotus spent the best twenty years of his life in travelling
over the greater part of the known world, studying the
history, geography, and customs of the countries he visited.
Thebes and Memphis, Tyre and Jerusalem, Babylon and Ecbat’ana—with
all he made personal acquaintance, extending
his tour as far west as the Greek settlements in Italy, and as
far south as the first cataract of the Nile.</p>

<p>The marvellousness of the stories he collected brought down
upon Herodotus the ridicule of his fellow-citizens; so quitting
Halicarnassus when about thirty-seven years of age, he settled
at Athens. Here, it is related, he read his history, still in the
rough, to the admiring people, who voted him a handsome
reward. Here also he seems to have become intimate with
Sophocles and his great contemporaries; and here, perhaps,
his ambition was kindled to add another star to the galaxy
that made Athens the glory of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>Not long, however, did Herodotus remain at the capital.
As one of a band of colonists sent out by Pericles in 443 B.C.,
he crossed to Italy, and aided in founding the town of Thurii,
near the ruins of Syb’aris (see Map, p. 304). At Thurii he
spent his last years in revising, enlarging, and polishing his
history; yet we are not to believe that he ceased to indulge
his passion for travelling when Sicily and southern Italy lay
so invitingly before him. He died at the age of sixty, leaving
the great work of his life unfinished.</p>

<p>The main subject of our author’s work is the Græco-Persian
War and the triumph of his country. His narrative is from
time to time relieved by delightful episodes. Indeed, we owe
to him not a few of those romantic tales that invest ancient
history with its peculiar charm; while modern research has
verified many of the wonder-stories that provoked the derision
of his countrymen. Nor do his digressions mar the unity of
his history, which is planned and developed as skilfully as a
drama of Sophocles.</p>

<p>The style of Herodotus is poetical, clear, familiar, fascinating,
and marked by a pleasing variety. “His animation,” says
Macaulay, “his simple-hearted tenderness, his wonderful talent
for description and dialogue, and the pure sweet flow of his
language, place him at the head of narrators.” His history is
the first work of its kind that has descended to us entire.
It is divided into nine books, said to have been read by the
author at the Olympic Games, and there to have received the
names of the Nine Muses, which they still bear.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Certainly
no names could have been more appropriately connected
with a work that has entitled its author to be called through
all time “the Father of History.”—Extracts follow:—</p>

<p class="center">XERXES AND THE PILOT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is said that Xerxes, leaving Athens, came to a city called Eïon,
on the banks of the Stry’mon. Hence he proceeded no farther by
land, but, intrusting the conduct of his forces to Hydarnes, with orders
to march them to the Hellespont, he went on board a Phœnician
vessel to cross over into Asia. After he had embarked, a heavy and
tempestuous wind set in from the lake; which, on account of the great
number of Persians on board, attendant upon Xerxes, made the situation
of the vessel extremely dangerous. The king, in a transport of
terror, inquired aloud of the pilot if he thought they were safe.</p>

<p>‘By no means,’ was the answer, ‘unless we could be rid of some of
this multitude.’</p>

<p>Upon this Xerxes exclaimed, ‘Persians, let me now see which of
you loves his prince; my safety, it seems, depends on you.’</p>

<p>As soon as he had spoken, they first bowed themselves before him,
and then leaped into the sea. The vessel being thus lightened,
Xerxes was safely landed in Asia. As soon as he got on shore, he rewarded
the pilot with a golden crown for preserving the life of the
king; but, as he had caused so many Persians to perish, he cut off
his head.”—<span class="smcap">Beloe.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="center">ANECDOTE OF QUEEN NITOCRIS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nitocris had her tomb constructed in the upper part of one of the
principal gateways of the city, high above the heads of the passers-by,
with this inscription cut upon it:—’If there be one among my
successors on the throne of Babylon who is in want of treasure, let
him open my tomb, and take as much as he chooses; not, however,
unless he be truly in want, for it will not be for his good.’</p>

<p>This tomb continued untouched until Darius came to the kingdom.
To him it seemed a monstrous thing that he should be unable to use
one of the gates of the town, and that a sum of money should be lying
idle, and moreover inviting his grasp, and he not seize upon it. Now
he could not use the gate, because, as he drove through, the dead
body would have been over his head.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he opened the tomb; but, instead of money, found
only the dead body, and a writing which said:—’Hadst thou not
been insatiate of pelf, and careless how thou gottest it, thou wouldst
not have broken open the sepulchres of the dead.’”</p>
</div>


<p class="center">CUSTOMS OF THE BABYLONIANS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of their customs, whereof I shall now proceed to give an account,
the following is in my judgment the wisest. Once a year, in each
village, the maidens of age to marry were collected all together into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
one place; while the men stood round them in a circle. Then a herald
called up the damsels one by one, and offered them for sale. He
began with the most beautiful. When she was sold for no small sum
of money, he offered for sale the one who came next to her in beauty.
All of them were sold to be wives.</p>

<p>The richest of the Babylonians who wished to wed, bid against
each other for the loveliest maidens; while the humbler wife-seekers,
who were indifferent about beauty, took the more homely damsels
with marriage-portions. For the custom was that when the
herald had gone through the whole number of the beautiful damsels,
he should then call up the ugliest—a cripple, if there chanced to be
one—and offer her to the men, asking who would agree to take her
with the smallest marriage-portion. And the man who offered to
take the smallest sum, had her assigned to him. The marriage-portions
were furnished by the money paid for the beautiful damsels,
and thus the fairer maidens portioned out the uglier.</p>

<p>No one was allowed to give his daughter in marriage to the man
of his choice, nor might any one carry away the damsel whom he
had purchased without finding bail really and truly to make her his
wife. All who liked might come, even from distant villages, and
bid for the women.</p>

<p>The Babylonians have no physicians; but when a man is ill, they
lay him in the public square, and the passers-by come up to him, and
if they have ever had his disease themselves or have known any one
who has suffered from it, they give him advice, recommending him
to do whatever they found good in their own case, or in the case
known to them. And no one is allowed to pass the sick man in
silence without asking him what his ailment is.”—<span class="smcap">Rawlinson.</span></p>
</div>


<p><b>Thucydides</b>, on whom the mantle of Herodotus descended,
was born in a village of Attica about 471 B.C. We may
believe that he received a polite education, and became proficient
in military science at an early age. It was in the
prime of manhood, if the oft-repeated story is to be credited,
that the history of Herodotus, read before an assembled
throng, brought tears to his eyes and fired him with a desire
to emulate its distinguished author. Greece was then on the
eve of the Peloponnesian War, in which the rival states Athens
and Sparta figured as chief actors. Thucydides anticipated
the impending storm, and discerned his opportunity;
this war should be his subject, and even before it began he
was busy collecting preliminary information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Nor did he serve his country merely in the capacity of historian.
He engaged actively in the contest, and received as
his reward the command of an Athenian squadron. But he
committed an unpardonable sin by failing to save a town,
which surrendered to the Spartans before he could arrive
with assistance. Instigated by Cleon, his countrymen deprived
him of his position and cast him forth an exile.</p>

<p>Thucydides retired to Thrace, where he had a valuable interest
in certain gold-mines, and there devoted himself to the
preparation of his history, narrowly watching the progress of
events and gathering intelligence with the utmost care. His
exile of twenty years was indeed “the Muses’ blessing;” it
enabled him to pursue his studies without interruption. Long
after his death, the plane-tree in whose shadow he was accustomed
to compose, was pointed out to travellers.</p>

<p>Thucydides traced the Peloponnesian War to the middle
of its twenty-first year (411 B.C.), leaving it to be finished by
another. Why he did not complete it himself, being in possession
of the necessary materials, does not appear. After
the Athenian power was broken by Sparta (404 B.C.), the
decree of banishment was revoked; but whether Thucydides
ever returned to Athens is a matter of doubt. According to
one account, he went back to fall the victim of a conspiracy;
from another we are led to infer that he died a natural death
in Thrace about 391 B.C.</p>

<p>The “History of the Peloponnesian War” is remarkable
for its accuracy and impartiality. Truth was the great object
of its author, who, dispassionate and unprejudiced, ignores
the ingratitude of his country, betrays no resentment even
when he speaks of Cleon, and does full justice to his Spartan
foes. He intended his work to be an authority, “a possession
for everlasting.” In it we find the first attempts to treat
the philosophy of history, to trace events to their ultimate
causes, and deduce from the past lessons for the future. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
style is nervous, concise, stately, and even rises to the sublime;
but lacks harmony, and is sometimes obscure. About
one fourth of his work is composed of speeches, which indeed
make an agreeable variety, but are often involved, and
in parts all but unintelligible. Antithesis is a frequent figure.</p>

<p>Despite its faults, the history of Thucydides has always
been a favorite. Charles V. was never without a copy when
on a campaign, and the philosopher Hobbes declared that
he valued its eight books above all the rest of Greek historical
literature. The extract selected is a description of the
plague which broke out at Athens in the year 430, while the
Lacedæmonians were ravaging Attica, and which the historian
contracted himself, but fortunately survived.</p>


<p class="center">THE PLAGUE AT ATHENS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While the nature of this distemper was such as to baffle all description,
and its attacks were almost too grievous for human nature
to endure, it was still in the following circumstance that its difference
from all ordinary disorders was most clearly shown. All the
birds and beasts that prey upon human bodies either abstained from
touching them (though there were many lying unburied), or died
after tasting them. In proof of this, it was noticed that birds of
this kind actually disappeared; they were not about the bodies, or
indeed to be seen at all. But of course the effects which I have
mentioned could best be studied in a domestic animal like the dog.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary
disorders; or, if any case occurred, it ended in this. Some died of
neglect, others in the midst of every attention. No remedy was
found that could be used as a specific; for what did good in one
case, did harm in another. Strong and weak constitutions proved
equally incapable of resistance, all alike being swept away, although
dieted with the utmost precaution.</p>

<p>By far the most terrible feature in the malady was the dejection
which ensued when they felt themselves sickening; for the despair
into which they instantly fell took away their power of resistance,
and left them a much easier prey to the disorder. Besides which,
there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through
having caught the infection in nursing each other. This caused the
greatest mortality. On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit
each other, they perished from neglect: indeed, many houses were
emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other hand, if
they ventured to do so, death was the consequence.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
<p>This was especially the case with such as made any pretensions
to goodness: a sense of honor prevented them from sparing themselves
in their attendance at their friends’ houses, where even the
members of the family were at last worn out by the moans of the
dying, and succumbed to the force of the disaster. Yet it was with
those who had recovered from the disease that the sick found most
compassion. These knew what it was from experience, and had
now no fear for themselves; for the same man was never attacked
a second time—never at least fatally. And such persons not only
received the congratulations of others, but themselves also in the
elation of the moment half entertained the vain hope that they
were for the future safe from any disease whatever.</p>

<p>An aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the
country into the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals.
As there were no houses to receive them, they had to be
lodged at the hot season of the year in stifling cabins, where the
mortality raged without restraint; bodies lay one upon another in
the agonies of thirst, and half-dead creatures reeled about the
streets and round all the fountains in their longing for water.
The sacred places, also, in which they had quartered themselves,
were full of corpses of persons that had died there.</p>

<p>All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and they
buried the bodies as best they could. Many from want of the
proper appliances, through so many of their friends having died
already, had recourse to the most shameless sepultures: sometimes
getting the start of those who had raised a pile, they threw their
own dead body upon the stranger’s pile and ignited it; sometimes
they tossed the corpse, which they were carrying, on the top of another
which was burning, and so went off.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed
its origin to the plague. Men now coolly ventured on what they had
formerly done in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the
rapid transitions produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying
and those who before had nothing succeeding to their property.
So they resolved to spend quickly and enjoy themselves, regarding
their lives and riches as alike things of a day. Perseverance in
what men called honor was popular with none, it was so uncertain
whether they would be spared to attain the object; but present enjoyment,
and all that contributed to it, was laid down as both honorable
and useful. Fear of gods or law of man there was none to
restrain them. As for the first, they judged it to be just the same
whether they worshipped the gods or not, as they saw all alike perishing;
and for the last, no one expected to live to be brought to
trial for his offences, but felt that a far severer sentence had been
already passed upon them and hung even over their heads, and before
this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy life a little.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on
the Athenians; death raging within the city and devastation with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>out.
Among other things which they remembered in their distress
was, very naturally, the following verse, which the old men said had
long ago been uttered:</p>

<p class="center">
‘A Dorian war shall come, and with it death.’”</p>

<p><b>Xenophon</b>, who in his “Hellenica” continued the story of
the Peloponnesian War left unfinished by Thucydides, and
carried the history of Greece as far as the battle of Mantine’a,
362 B.C., was born at Athens shortly after the middle of the
fifth century. Of his early life we know nothing, save that he
was the friend and pupil of Socrates; who, it is related, prepossessed
with his intelligent countenance, once stopped him
in a narrow way and demanded where men were made good
and honest. Confused by the unexpected inquiry from so
great a teacher, the boy hesitated; whereupon, the philosopher
exclaimed, “Follow me and learn.” Xenophon obeyed,
and became a faithful student of his master’s moral and philosophical
doctrines. Together they braved the perils of the
Peloponnesian War; and in the battle of De’lium (424 B.C.),
where the flower of Athens’ chivalry fell, Xenophon’s life is
said to have been saved by Socrates.</p>

<p>At the solicitation of his friend, Proxenus the Bœotian,
Xenophon joined as a volunteer the famous Expedition of
the Ten Thousand, made in the interest of Cyrus the Younger
against his elder brother Artaxerxes, who occupied the Persian
throne. Feeling the necessity of securing soldiers superior
in bravery and discipline to the barbarian hordes
through which he must cut his way to the capital, Cyrus
supported the Spartans in the Peloponnesian War, in order
to secure their aid in dethroning Artaxerxes. Accordingly, at
his summons, about 10,000 Spartans and other Greeks, deceived
at first as to the real object of the campaign, flocked
to his standard, and in the spring of 401 B.C., with 100,000
Eastern troops, entered the confines of the Persian Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>On the plain of Cunaxa, ninety miles from Babylon, the
decisive battle took place between the brothers, Artaxerxes
having at his back an army of nearly a million men. Superior
numbers, however, availed little against the superior discipline
of the Greeks, who quickly routed the wing opposed
to them; but Cyrus, already hailed as king, imprudently
spurred into the disordered ranks of the foe, and was struck
down while engaged in a furious hand-to-hand conflict with
Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>The fall of Cyrus was the signal for his Asiatic troops to
disperse, and the victors found themselves deserted in the
heart of the enemy’s country, more than 1,200 miles from
home. Their generals were soon after seized at a conference
and put to death. In this crisis, by the advice of Xenophon,
inspired as he tells us by a dream, new leaders were
chosen, he himself in the place of his friend Proxenus, one
of the murdered chiefs. A retreat was determined upon;
and during fifteen months of indescribable hardships, he was
the patient guide, the sympathetic but vigilant and prudent
commander. At last, from a mountain height, the glittering
Euxine broke upon the view of the van, a glad shout rent the
air—“the Sea! the Sea!”—proclaiming that their sufferings
were over, while officers and soldiers wept in each other’s
arms. Here, in the neighborhood of Greek settlements, they
were safe, and the march home was easy. The 8,600 survivors
owed their lives to Xenophon.</p>

<p>This “Retreat” of the Greeks is the subject of Xenophon’s
graphic and interesting history in seven books, the “Anabasis”
(<i>march up</i>, though most of the work is occupied with
what happened on the march <i>down</i>). The chaste, simple
style of the author, who throughout modestly speaks of himself
in the third person, recommends his pages to readers
of every class. He writes to the point; there is no straining
for effect. We extract the passage relating to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>


<p class="center">XENOPHON’S DREAM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After the generals were made prisoners, and such of the captains
and soldiers as had accompanied them were put to death, the Greeks
were in great perplexity, reflecting that they were not far from the
king’s residence; that there were around them, on all sides, many
hostile nations and cities; that no one would any longer afford them
opportunities of purchasing provisions; that they were distant from
Greece not less than ten thousand stadia; that there was no one to
guide them on the way; that impassable rivers would intercept them
in the midst of their course; that the Babylonians who had gone up
with Cyrus had deserted them; and that they were left alone, having
no cavalry to support them.</p>

<p>Reflecting, I say, on these circumstances, and being disheartened
at them, few tasted food that evening, few kindled fires; and many
did not come to the place of arms during the night, but lay down to
sleep where they severally happened to be, unable to sleep for sorrow
and longing for their country, their parents, their wives and children,
whom they never expected to see again. In this state of mind they
all went to their resting-places.</p>

<p>When this perplexity occurred, Xenophon was distressed as well
as the other Greeks, and unable to rest; but having at length got a
little sleep, he had a dream, in which, in the midst of a thunder-storm,
a bolt seemed to him to fall upon his father’s house, and the house in
consequence became all in a blaze. Greatly frightened, he immediately
awoke, and considered his dream as in one respect favorable,
inasmuch as, being in troubles and dangers, he seemed to behold a
great light from Jupiter; but in another respect he was alarmed, because
the dream appeared to him to be from Jupiter, who was a king,
and the fire to blaze all around him, lest he should be unable to escape
from the king’s territories, but should be hemmed in on all sides
by inextricable difficulties.</p>

<p>What it betokens, however, to see such a dream, we may conjecture
from the occurrences that happened after the dream. What immediately
followed was this. As soon as he awoke, the thought that
first occurred to him was, ‘Why do I lie here? The night is passing
away. With daylight it is probable that the enemy will come upon
us; and, if we once fall into the hands of the king, what is there to
prevent us from being put to death with ignominy, after witnessing
the most grievous sufferings among our comrades, and enduring every
severity of torture ourselves? Yet no one concerts measures or takes
thought for our defence, but we lie still, as if we were at liberty to
enjoy repose. From what city, then, do I expect a leader to undertake
our defence? What age am I waiting for, to come to myself?
Assuredly I shall never be older, if I give myself up to the enemy
to-day.’ After these reflections he arose, and called together, in the
first place, the captains that were under Proxenus.</p>

<p>When they were assembled, he said, ‘For my part, captains, I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>not
sleep, nor, I should think, can you; nor can I lie still any longer,
when I consider in what circumstances we are placed. For it is plain
that the enemy did not openly manifest hostility toward us, until they
thought that they had judiciously arranged their plans; but on our
side no one takes any thought how we may best maintain a contest
with them. Yet if we prove remiss, and fall into the power of the
king, what may we not expect to suffer from a man who cut off the
head and hand of his own brother by the same mother and father,
even after he was dead, and fixed them upon a stake? What may
not we, I say, expect to suffer, who have no relative to take our part,
and who have marched against him to make him a subject instead
of a monarch, and to put him to death if it should lie in our power?
Will he not proceed to every extremity, that by reducing us to the
last degree of ignominious suffering, he may inspire all men with a
dread of ever taking the field against him? We must, therefore, try
every expedient not to fall into his hands.</p>

<p>For myself, I never ceased, while the truce lasted, to consider
ourselves as objects of pity, and to regard the king and his people as
objects of envy; as I contemplated how extensive and valuable a
country they possessed, how great an abundance of provisions, how
many slaves and cattle, and how vast a quantity of gold and raiment.
But since they have put an end to peace, their own haughtiness and
our mistrust seem likewise to be brought to an end; for the advantages
which I have mentioned lie now as prizes between us, for whichsoever
of us shall prove the better men. And the gods are the judges
of the contest, who, as is just, will be on our side; since the enemy
have offended them by perjury, while we, though seeing many good
things to tempt us, have resolutely abstained from all of them through
regard to our oaths; so that, as it seems to me, we may advance to
the combat with much greater confidence than they can feel.</p>

<p>We have bodies, moreover, better able than theirs to endure cold
and toil; and we have, with the help of the gods, more resolute
minds; while the enemy, if the gods, as before, grant us success, will
be found more obnoxious to wounds and death than we are. But
possibly others of you entertain the same thoughts; let us not then,
in the name of Heaven, wait for others to come and exhort us to noble
deeds, but let us be ourselves the first to excite others to exert their
valor. Prove yourselves the bravest of the captains, and more worthy
to lead than those who are now leaders. As for me, if you wish to
take the start, in the course, I am willing to follow you; or, if you
appoint me to be a leader, I shall not make my youth an excuse,
but shall think myself sufficiently mature to defend myself against
harm.’”—<span class="smcap">Watson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>For his sympathy with Sparta, and possibly for sharing the
opinions of his beloved teacher Socrates, Xenophon was banished
from Athens; but he was recompensed by the Lacedæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>monians
with a house and piece of land in E’lis. Here, amid
lovely meadows and woodlands, he built a temple to the goddess
Diana in fulfilment of a vow he had made when encircled
by dangers in Asia. Here, free from the cares of public life,
he passed many years, happy in the society of his wife, children,
and friends, dividing his time among his farm, his hunting-parks,
and his study. He died at the age of ninety.—Of
his two sons, one fell on the field of Mantinea, after dealing
the great Epaminondas his death-blow.</p>

<p>Besides the “Anabasis” and “Hellenica,” Xenophon wrote
the “Cy’ropædi’a”(<i>education of Cyrus</i>—the elder Cyrus, king
of Persia), a semi-didactic, semi-historical fiction, illustrating
a model system of education and setting forth his ideal of
government—a perfect monarchy. He is also the author of
several works written in defence of Socrates or as expositions
of his philosophy, of which the “Memorabilia” (<i>memoirs</i>) is
particularly interesting, teeming as it does with sayings and
anecdotes of the sage.</p>

<p>In addition to his merits as an historian, Xenophon may
justly claim the distinction of having been the first essayist:
we have from his pen essays on the Policy of Lacedæmon, on
the Chase, Horsemanship, and Cavalry Tactics, not to mention
several political treatises ascribed to him. A creditable representative
of elegant Attic prose, Xenophon has been called
<i>the Attic Muse</i>.</p>


<p><b>Ctesias</b>, a Greek physician attached to the Persian court,
who dressed the wounds of Artaxerxes after the battle of Cunaxa,
compiled a history of Persia in twenty-three books, a
description of India, and a variety of other works. Of his
writings, which were in the Ionic dialect, little has survived.</p>


<p><b>Theopompus</b> (probably 378-304 B.C.) is also worthy of
mention as an historian. He wrote a History of Greece from
411 to 394 B.C., and “Philippica,” in fifty-eight books, in which
he sketched the character of Philip of Macedon. Of the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
work numerous fragments remain. Ancient critics give him
credit for general accuracy, though he took rather too rose-colored
views of his hero Philip as the promoter of Grecian
civilization.</p>


<h4>PHILOSOPHY.</h4>

<p>The earliest philosophical investigations were made by
Ionians, and <span class="smcap">Thales</span> of Miletus is recognized as the founder
of Greek philosophy. To him and to Pythagoras the various
systems may all be traced.</p>


<p><b>The Ionic School</b> of Thales, devoted to physical science,
rapidly developed, theory after theory being brought forward
to explain the universe and the nature of Deity. One philosopher
made the Supreme Being an all-pervading, divine air;
another, Heracli’tus “the Obscure,” represented God as a
subtile flame, and reduced the universe to an eternal fire.</p>

<p>A notable step in advance was taken by <span class="smcap">Anaxagoras</span> (500-428
B.C.), who succeeded to the leadership of this school.
The first to make the study of philosophy fashionable at
Athens, he became the instructor of some of her great men,
Socrates among the number. He represented God as a divine
<i>mind</i>, acting on the material world with intelligence and design.
Well did Aristotle say that Anaxagoras was like a sober
man among stammering drunkards, when compared with earlier
philosophers. As an astronomer, he anticipated some of
the discoveries of more recent times; he correctly explained
eclipses, taught that the sun was a molten ball, that from it
the moon borrowed her light, that the lunar surface was diversified
with mountains and valleys, and that the earth itself
had been the scene of terrible convulsions.</p>


<p><b>The Italic School</b> had meanwhile been founded by <span class="smcap">Pythag’oras</span>,
of Samos, born about 540 B.C. He settled in Croto’na,
a Greek town of southern Italy, and there imparted to his disciples
the philosophical principles which he had gathered in
other lands, particularly Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>Pythagoras modestly styled himself a lover of wisdom (<i>philosopher</i>),
not a wise man (<i>sophist</i>). Among his doctrines were
the mysterious theory that <i>number</i> is the first principle of all
things, the transmigration of souls, and a system of future rewards
and punishments. He forestalled Copernicus in his
discovery of the true theory of the solar system—that the
sun, and not the earth, as was then believed, is its centre; he
taught that the moon was inhabited and described the heavenly
bodies as producing harmonious tones in their passage
through ether, from which his followers were accustomed to
say that to him the gods had revealed “the music of the
spheres.”</p>

<p>With such perfect confidence did his disciples regard their
master, who usually gave his instructions from behind a thick
curtain, that when any one called their doctrines in question
they deemed it sufficient to reply, “He said so” (<i>ipse
dixit</i>). Indeed, they invested him with supernatural powers,
nor, according to his early biographers, did he deny the
soft impeachment. On one occasion, we are told, to convince
his pupils that he was a god, he showed them his
thigh, which was of gold, and declared that he had assumed
the form of humanity only the more readily to impart his
lessons to mankind.</p>

<p>Pythagoras was the inventor of the monochord, a one-stringed
instrument designed to measure musical intervals,—and
also of the more useful, if humbler, Multiplication Table.
He is the first who practised mesmerism; at least so we may
account for his subduing a fierce Daunian bear, and taming
beasts and birds by gently passing his hands over their
bodies.</p>

<p>There are no genuine remnants of this author. The celebrated
“Golden Verses,” long attributed to him, there is
reason for supposing to have been inspired by his teachings,
but written by one of his pupils:—</p>

<p>As the Ionics made physics everything, so the Pythagoreans
regarded mathematical science as the <i>summum bonum</i>.
In their master’s eyes the world was “a living arithmetic,”
and virtue a proportion of all the faculties of the soul. A
mystical relation between mathematical and moral truths was
a principle of his philosophy.</p>

<p>Prominent among the followers of Pythagoras was <span class="smcap">Empedocles</span>,
of Agrigentum in Sicily (450 B.C.), who combined
the previous theories of nature in his own, viz., that four elements—earth,
air, fire, and water—enter into the constitution
of the universe, and that these are constantly animated by
the two opposing forces of Love and Strife. A peculiar doctrine
of his was that like is perceived only by like; thus our
knowledge of other bodies is due to minute emanations from
their substance which enter the pores and impress corresponding
elements in our own frames.</p>

<p>Empedocles is said to have arrogated to himself the importance
of a god, going about in a purple robe confined with a
belt of gold, performing wonderful cures. According to an
old legend, he sought to create the belief that he had been
translated to heaven, by secretly throwing himself into the
crater of Mt. Etna; but the volcano, in a subsequent eruption,
cast forth one of his brazen sandals and so exposed
the fraud. He probably lost his life by accident while examining
the crater.</p>

<p>From the Italic School sprung the sects known as Eleatic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
Epicurean, and Skeptic. The Eleatic School was founded
by <span class="smcap">Xenoph’anes</span> (600-500 B.C.), a contemporary of Pythagoras,
and derived its name from the town of E’lea in southern
Italy.</p>

<p>Xenophanes asserted the unity of the Deity. “There is
one god,” he said, “among gods and men the greatest:
unlike to mortals in outward shape, unlike in mind and
thoughts.” This was truly a sublime stand to take in an age
of polytheism; he who feared not to face a superstitious people
with such a doctrine, and ridicule even their divine Homer
for his degrading pictures of the deities, deserves to be
ranked among the greatest philosophers of Greece.</p>

<p>The noble conception of Deity entertained by Xenophanes
was soon perverted. We find his pupil <span class="smcap">Parmen’ides</span> “the
Great” in the next century doing away with the personality
of God, and confounding the divine nature with pure being,
which he made equivalent to thought.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Democ’ritus</span>, of Abde’ra in Thrace (460-357 B.C.), known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
as the laughing philosopher from his constantly deriding the
weaknesses of men, put forth the <i>atomic theory</i>,—that the universe
is made up of countless minute, intangible atoms, and
that in the motion of such atoms, round and fiery, consisted
the movements of the mind and soul. God had no place in
this philosophy; matter, time, space, and motion, were eternal.
Bodies were formed by the fortuitous concurrence of
atoms; and by the affinities and motions of atoms in the
vacuum that made up the universe, all natural phenomena
were produced.</p>

<p>Such was the wisdom of one who laughed at the follies of
his fellows, and is stated to have put out his own eyes that
nothing might distract the current of his thoughts.</p>


<p><b>School of Epicurus.</b>—The materialism of Democritus was
at a later day elaborated by <span class="smcap">Epicurus</span> (born on Samos about
340 B.C.) into a system of philosophy which gained so many
converts that we are told whole cities could not contain the
friends and followers of its author. According to the Epicurean
philosophy, chance governed the world of atoms; there
was no life beyond the grave. The gods were immortal, but
were mere figure-heads, enjoying an emotionless inactivity,
indifferent alike to the vices and fortunes of men: most likely
Epicurus did not believe in any gods at all, but allowed their
existence, as nonentities, that he might not shock the prejudices
of the Athenians. Pleasure he made the chief end of
life; but with him pleasure was not sensual indulgence; it
lay in freedom from pain, the sober exercise of reason, and
the nobler enjoyments of man’s higher nature. Such a doctrine,
it is plain, was but too easy of perversion. The pure,
high-toned “pleasure” of the moral Epicurus degenerated
with the voluptuaries and profligates that adopted his tenets
into the vilest excesses, and the very name <i>epicure</i> is applied
to one unduly addicted to the gratifying of the appetite.</p>


<p><b>The Skeptical Philosophy.</b>—<span class="smcap">Pyrrho</span>, who flourished about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
300 B.C., was the father of the Skeptics. They held that
there was no standard of truth appreciable by the human
mind; nothing can therefore be asserted as true. Pyrrho
doubted everything; his disciples used to follow him, lest, in
practically applying his theory, he should be run over in the
streets or walk off a precipice.</p>


<p><b>The Socratic School.</b>—When Socrates (470-399 B.C.) came
upon the stage in the golden period of Athens, it was to denounce
the atheistical philosophy of his predecessors, and
take the field against the Sophists, who made endless disputation,
fallacious but specious, the head and front of their
system. “These word-snapping quibblers,” says Felton,
“were prodigious favorites with the Athenians,—men who
proved that right was wrong, and wrong right, and that there
was neither wrong nor right; that knowing one thing is
knowing everything, and that there is no such thing as knowing
anything at all; that as the beautiful exists by the presence
of beauty, so a man becomes an ass by the presence
of an ass; and so on, ringing myriads of changes, like the
fools in Shakespeare, upon these quirks of jugglery.”</p>

<p>Socrates had an effective way of dealing with these gentry.
By cunningly contrived questions, which at first seemed to
have no bearing on the point at issue, he led them on from
admission to admission, until he involved them in absurdities
and convicted them out of their own mouths.</p>

<p>For one like Socrates, the mythology of Greece was too
gross, the speculations of the philosophy then current were
too unreal and hollow. He aspired to something better. At
length the unity of God, the soul’s immortality, and the moral
responsibility of man, dawned upon his mind—sublime truths
which he might well have drawn from revelation itself. The
practice of virtue he inculcated as indispensable to happiness
and true religion. A <i>demon</i>, or secret influence, he said,
constantly attended him, and was his director in the work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
social reform no less than in the every-day affairs of life.
Whether he deceived himself in this belief or strove to deceive
others into it that he might gain credence for his doctrines,
certain it is that his teachings exercised a most wholesome
influence. All subsequent Greek philosophy is stamped
with their impress. (<i>See Blackie’s “Horæ Hellenicæ.”</i>)</p>

<p>In his domestic relations, Socrates was not happy. Believing
it incumbent on him to devote every moment to philosophical
inquiry or exhortations of the people to practical
morality, he was wont to neglect his legitimate business of
stone-cutting, and leave his family to provide for its own support.
This was too much for his good wife Xantippe. Something
of a shrew even under the best of circumstances, we
may imagine that she made his household rather hot, particularly
when he brought guests home to dinner and there
was nothing in the larder. On one occasion she went so
far as to give emphasis to her reproaches with a shower of
dish-water. The dripping philosopher, not in the least disturbed,
calmly remarked, “I thought after so much thunder,
we should have some rain.”</p>

<p>Socrates declined the invitation of a Macedonian prince to
live in luxury at his court, with the characteristic reply, “At
Athens meal is two-pence the measure, and water may be
had for nothing.” He clung to Athens to the last, and so
doing won a martyr’s crown. Accused of impiety in corrupting
the religious belief of the young committed to his charge,
he was condemned to drink the fatal hemlock. Surrounded
by sorrowing disciples, who had bribed the jailer and vainly
urged him to fly while there was yet time, he calmly placed
the cup to his lips, and soon after passed away with not a
doubt as to “the undiscovered country.” “I derive confidence,”
said he, “from the hope that something of man remains
after death, and that the condition of good men will
then be much better than that of the bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>Socrates failed to commit his philosophy to writing; it is
from the pages of Xenophon and Plato, his most devoted admirers,
that we have learned his doctrines.</p>

<p>The principal schools that originated in the Socratic were
the Academic, Peripatetic, Cynic, and Stoic.</p>


<p><b>Academic School.—Plato.</b>—The Academic School was
founded by Socrates’ pupil, Plato, and derived its name from
the grove of Acade’mus, a public garden at Athens in which
this philosopher was accustomed to deliver his lectures.
Beneath its planes and olives flowed the stream Cephissus;
statues and temples were
scattered through its
shade, and solitary paths
invited to rest and meditation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Plato was noble-born, tracing his descent from King Codrus
through one parent and from Solon through the other.
His great genius was early seen. After mastering the elementary
branches, he turned his attention to painting and
poetry; but when he compared an epic on which he had tried
his hand with Homer’s, he threw it into the fire in disgust.
Chancing to hear Socrates discourse, he forthwith resolved to
forsake the ornamental arts and study philosophy. So, when
only twenty, Plato attached himself to Socrates; his admiration
quickly ripened into an abiding affection; and for eight
years he sat at the philosopher’s feet as a pupil, though now
and then obtruding new theories of his own. In the dark
days of his master’s trial and condemnation, he was still faithful;
and when the judges silenced his speech in defence of
Socrates, he would have resorted to the money-argument,
which then, as now, seldom failed, had not the high-minded
sage refused to secure life by such ignoble means.</p>

<p>After the execution of Socrates, Plato pursued his studies
in foreign lands. He visited Italy, Sicily, and Egypt, carefully
examining their different systems of philosophy, and possibly
even making the acquaintance of the Hebrew Scriptures.
During this tour he is related to have been sold into slavery
at the instigation of Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, whom he
had offended by his bold expressions.</p>

<p>On his return to Athens, in accordance with a long-cherished
plan, Plato opened an humble dwelling in the grove of
Academus for the reception of pupils, and founded the famous
Academic School. He soon became the most popular man
in Athens. Crowds thronged to his lectures and dialogues,
which were free to all; and even ladies assumed male attire,
that they might mingle unnoticed with the listeners and drink
in the eloquence which flowed from his lips. His fame went
abroad also. Foreign potentates sought his aid in adjusting
political difficulties; and twice, by request, he returned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Syracusan court to effect a reform in the government—but
in this case, without success.</p>

<p>On his eighty-second birthday, while he was pursuing his
accustomed occupation, the stylus suddenly fell from Plato’s
hand, and he expired. Under the trees so long associated
with his kindly instruction, he found a final resting-place; an
admiring country preserved his memory by altars and statues;
and the verdict of succeeding generations has been that Plato
was the greatest philosopher of antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato’s Philosophical System.</span>—Plato was an enthusiast
in the pursuit of truth. He believed in a personal God, rational,
immutable, eternal. He realized that man could never
attain absolute wisdom, possible to God alone; and looked
upon philosophy as “a longing after heavenly wisdom.” He
sought to correct abuses, to elevate humanity; and made
man’s highest duty consist in searching out God and imitating
the perfection of the Almighty as his rule of conduct.
The four cardinal virtues were wisdom, temperance, courage,
and justice; but none could be virtuous without aid from on
high. (<i>Read Bulkley’s “Plato’s Best Thoughts.”</i>)</p>

<p>The soul, an emanation from the Supreme Mind, was immortal.
It existed before its union with the body, and all
earthly knowledge is but the recollection of what it possessed
in some former state. When, disembodied, it stood face to
face with kindred immaterial essences, it acquired those <i>ideas</i>,
or <i>forms</i>, which figure so prominently in the Platonic system—interpreted
by some to mean veritable objective existences
too subtile to be discerned by the eye of flesh, and by others
explained as mere intuitions or generalizations having no objective
reality.</p>

<p>Plato regarded men as free agents, to be rewarded or punished
in a future life for their deeds in this. His poetical
fancy fixed on some distant star as the abode of the blessed.
The earth he supposed to occupy the centre of the universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
It was not eternal, but was made by an intelligent God, who
breathed into it a soul; so it was a living creature, self-active,
and gifted with the beautiful form of the sphere.</p>

<p>Nor did the philosopher forget to train the reasoning powers,
by the study of mathematics. The importance he attached
to this science may be inferred from the sign on his school:
“Let no one enter here who is a stranger to geometry.” Plato
has the honor of having been the inventor of geometrical
analysis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato’s Works</span>, which have descended to us unimpaired,
are in the form of dialogues—a delightful method of conveying
philosophical instruction, when, as in Plato’s case, the
personages introduced as speakers are salient characters, and
their idiosyncrasies are maintained throughout with discrimination.
The dull lessons of dialectics are thus enlivened by
graphic portraitures and happy strokes of humor. Plato’s
language is the perfection of Attic prose, beautified by a poetical
tinge. “If Jupiter should speak Greek,” said ancient
critics, “it would be Plato’s.” What Socrates dreamed on
the night before the young Plato entered his school—that a
cygnet came from the grove of Academus, and, after nestling
on his breast for a time, took its flight heavenward, singing
sweetly as it rose—is recorded as presaging his pupil’s sweet
mastery of words.</p>

<p>The Platonic Dialogues, thirty-five in number, discuss various
subjects. One of the finest is “Phædo,” written to prove
the immortal nature of the soul. It derives its name from the
beloved disciple of Socrates, who is here made by Plato, prevented
from being present himself, to describe their master’s
death-scene and repeat his last discourse. Full of sublime
and poetical conceptions, the “Phædo” aims at lifting the
mind above the sensual to the spiritual and eternal; at foreshadowing
the joys of the heavenly state, and painting death
as a thing to be desired rather than feared, since it is the por<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>tal
of bliss. The philosopher Cleom’brotus, on reading this
Dialogue, is said to have thrown himself into the sea to exchange
this life for the better one pictured by Plato.</p>


<p class="center">EXTRACT FROM PHÆDO.</p>

<p>(Socrates, having proved the immortality of the soul to the satisfaction of
all present in the prison, addresses them as follows.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Then, Cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable,
and our souls will truly exist in another world!”</p>

<p>“I am convinced, Socrates,” said Cebes, “and have nothing more
to object; but if my friend Simmias, or any one else, has any further
objection, he had better speak out, and not keep silence, since I do
not know to what other season he can defer the discussion, if there
is anything which he wants to say or have said.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing more to say,” replied Simmias; “nor can I see
any reason for doubt after what has been said. But I still feel and
cannot help feeling uncertain in my own mind, when I think of the
greatness of the subject and the feebleness of man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Simmias,” replied Socrates, “that is well said; but O my
friends! if the soul is really immortal, what care should be taken of
her, not only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, but
of eternity! And the danger of neglecting her from this point of
view does indeed appear to be awful. If death had only been the
end of all, the wicked would have had a good bargain in dying, for
they would have been happily quit not only of their body, but of
their own evil together with their souls. But now, inasmuch as the
soul is manifestly immortal, there is no release or salvation from evil
except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom. For the
soul, when on her progress to the world below, takes nothing with
her but nurture and education; and these are said greatly to benefit
or greatly to injure the departed, at the very beginning of his
pilgrimage in the other world.</p>

<p>“Wherefore, Simmias, seeing all these things, what ought not we
to do that we may obtain virtue and wisdom in this life? Fair is
the prize, and the hope great!</p>

<p>“A man of sense ought not to say that the description which I have
given of the soul and her mansions is exactly true. But I do say that,
inasmuch as the soul is shown to be immortal, he may venture to
think that something of the kind is true. The venture is a glorious
one, and he ought to comfort himself with words like these, which is
the reason why I lengthen out the tale.</p>

<p>“Wherefore, I say, let a man be of good cheer about his soul, who
has cast away the pleasures and ornaments of the body as alien
to him, and has followed after the pleasures of knowledge in this
life; who has arrayed the soul in her own proper jewels, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
temperance, and justice, and courage, and nobility, and truth—thus
adorned, she is ready to go on her journey to the world below when
her hour comes.</p>

<p>“You, Simmias and Cebes, and all other men, will depart at some
time or other. Me already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice of
fate calls. Soon I must drink the poison; and I think that I had
better repair to the bath first, in order that the women may not have
the trouble of washing my body after I am dead.”</p>

<p>When he had done speaking, Crito said: “And have you any commands
for us, Socrates? anything to say about your children, or any
other matter in which we can serve you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing particular,” he said: “only, as I have always told you,
I would have you look to yourselves; that is a service which you
may always be doing to me and mine as well as to yourselves.”</p>

<p>“We will do our best,” said Crito; “but in what way would you
have us bury you?”</p>

<p>“In any way that you like; only you must get hold of me, and
take care that I do not walk away from you.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to us, and added with a smile:—“I cannot make
Crito believe that I am the same Socrates who have been talking and
conducting the argument; he fancies that I am the other Socrates
whom he will soon see, a dead body—and he asks, How shall he bury
me? And though I have spoken many words in the endeavor to
show that when I have drunk the poison I shall leave you and go to
the joys of the blessed, these words of mine, with which I comforted
you and myself, have had, as I perceive, no effect upon Crito.</p>

<p>“You must be my surety to him that I shall not remain, but go
away and depart; and then he will suffer less at my death, and not
be grieved when he sees my body being burned or buried. I would
not have him sorrow at my hard lot, or say at the burial, ‘Thus we
lay out Socrates,’ or ‘Thus we follow him to the grave or bury him;’
for false words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the
soul with evil. Be of good cheer then, my dear Crito, and say that
you are burying my body only, and do with that as is usual, and as
you think best.—<span class="smcap">Jowett.</span>—(In this connection <i>read Grote’s “Plato
and the Other Companions of Socrates.”</i>)</p>

<p>In his “Republic,” Plato indulges in a political dream,
sketching an ideal government and embodying his conception
of absolute justice. In his “Atlantis,” he describes a large
island lying west of Europe, which some have tried to connect
with America.</p>

<p>The Academic School long survived its founder; but little
if any advance was made by his successors. Its fundamental
tenets outlived Greece and Rome, to reappear in the schools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
of modern times. Many of them are in wonderful harmony
with Christian doctrines; and such a resemblance to the Jewish
Scriptures has been detected in the writings of their author
that he has been called “the Attic Moses.”</p>


<p><b>Peripatetic School.—Aristotle.</b>—The Peripatetic was an offshoot
from the Academic School, its founder Aristotle having
for twenty years studied under Plato. Its influence cannot
be estimated; for 1,800 years, up to the revival of letters in
modern times, its author was recognized as the supreme authority
on every subject, whether by Moslem or Christian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> (384-322 B.C.) was born at the Thracian town
of Stagi’ra. Inheriting from his father literary tastes as well
as the means to gratify them, he selected Athens as the scene
of his labors, and there, at the age of seventeen, he entered
the Academy of Plato. So energetically did he apply himself,
not as a servile follower but often as a pioneer in new
paths of his own, that his master said he required the bit
rather than the spur, and styled him the Intellect of the
school. On one occasion, when none but this ardent pupil
was present to hear his lecture, Plato proceeded as usual,
saying that “so long as he had Aristotle for an audience, he
had the better half of Athens.” His industry was proverbial;
he grudged the time needed for repose, and used to sleep
with a ball in his hand, that when it fell from his grasp by
the relaxing of the muscles the noise would awaken him.</p>

<p>When Plato died, Aristotle retired from the Academy; and
in 342 B.C. he received the following letter from Philip of
Macedon, whose court he had visited as an ambassador:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Philip</span> to <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, wisheth health:</p>

<p>Be informed that I have a son, and that I am thankful to the gods,
not so much for his birth, as that he was born in the same age with
you; for if you will undertake the charge of his education, I assure
myself that he will become worthy of his father, and of the kingdom
which he will inherit.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was no declining such an invitation. At Stagira, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
native town, Philip provided a school and the accustomed
grove for instruction, in which the philosopher moulded the
mind of Alexander the future Conqueror. The king of Macedon
was more than satisfied with the results; and the royal
pupil owned his indebtedness to his teacher, exclaiming,
“Philip only gave me life, but Aristotle has taught me the
art of living well!”</p>

<p>When, on the assassination of Philip, Alexander mounted
the throne and embarked on that expedition which extended
the sway of Macedon over half the known world, he showed
his gratitude by making his instructor a munificent present
equivalent to nearly $1,000,000, and employed two or three
thousand men to fill his cabinets with specimens. Thus
supplied with material and funds, Aristotle, established in
Athens since 335 B.C. as a distinguished teacher despite
his traditional lisp and insignificant appearance, vigorously
prosecuted his scientific labors. At the Lyce’um, Apollo’s
temple, he gave instruction to his disciples, walking up and
down in the covered paths (<i>peripatoi</i>) about the building—whence
the name of his school, <i>Peripatetic</i>. He mastered all
existing knowledge, regarding learning as “an ornament to
men in prosperity, a refuge in adversity;” and for thirteen
years divided his time between his pupils and his literary
work.</p>

<p>The news of Alexander’s sudden death was the signal for
Aristotle’s enemies, no longer restrained by fear of his royal
friend, to show their hand. Impiety was alleged against
him; but mindful of the fate of Socrates, and, as he said, to
prevent the Athenians from sinning a second time against
philosophy, he retired to Chalcis on the island of Eubœa,
where he died within a year.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Philosophy and Writing of Aristotle.</span>—While to
some extent following his master, from several of Plato’s
doctrines Aristotle felt compelled to dissent; truth, he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
was dearer to him than any friend.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He did not accept the
Ideal theory, but inclined to materialism or to pantheism,
making <i>reason</i> divine and omnipresent. He doubted his own
immortality, holding that the soul could not exist apart from
the body, and that there is “nothing good or bad beyond to
the dead.” His style was dry, elliptical, and full of technicalities;
if we compare it with Plato’s, we have the opposite
poles of the magnet.</p>

<p>Plato was all imagination, Aristotle was thoroughly practical.
The inspiration of the one was a passionate love of
wisdom; the forte of the other was power of analysis, a wonderful
faculty of systemizing knowledge. The master captivated
the heart; the pupil convinced the reason. “The
philosophy of Plato,” says Dr. Draper, “is a gorgeous castle
in the air; that of Aristotle is a solid structure laboriously
founded on rock.”</p>

<p>Aristotle’s style is devoid of ornament, and his subjects
are too abstruse for the general run of readers; but he was
a keen observer and a close reasoner. A few paragraphs
from his Rhetoric, in which he analyzes the peculiarities
of old age, will show how well he understood human nature.</p>


<p class="center">THE DISPOSITION OF THE OLD.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those who are advanced in life, having been deceived in a
greater number of instances, err in everything more on the side of
defect than they ought. And they always <i>suppose</i>, but never <i>know</i>
certainly; and, questioning everything, they always subjoin a <i>perhaps</i>,
or a <i>possibly</i>. And they are apt to view things in an unfavorable
light; for a disposition thus to view things, is the judging of
everything on the worse side.</p>

<p>Moreover, they are apt to be suspicious from distrust, and they are
distrustful from their experience. And on this account they neither
love nor hate with great earnestness; but, conformably to the remark
of Bias, they both love as though about to hate, and hate as
though about to love. And they are pusillanimous, from their hav<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>ing
been humbled by the course of life; for they raise their desires
to nothing great or vast, but to things only which conduce to the
support of life.</p>

<p>And they are illiberal; for property is one of the necessaries; and
they are at the same time aware, from their experience, of the difficulty
of its acquisition, and of the ease with which it is lost. They
are timid and apprehensive of everything; for their disposition is
the reverse of that of the young; for they have been chilled by
years, but the young are warm in their temperament; so that their
age has paved the way to timidity; for fear is a certain kind of
chill.</p>

<p>And they are attached to life, and particularly at its last closing
day, from the circumstance that desire is of some object which is
absent, and that men more especially desire that of which they
stand in need.</p>

<p>They have self-love more than is fitting; for this too is a kind of
littleness of spirit. And they live in a greater degree than they
ought by the standard of expediency, and not of what is honorable,
by reason of their self-love: for what is expedient is good <i>relatively</i>
to one’s self, but what is honorable is good <i>absolutely</i>.</p>

<p>Again, they are not easily inspired with hope, on account of their
experience; for the majority of things are but paltry; wherefore the
generality turn out inferior to the expectation; and once more, on
account of their timidity they are apt to despond. And they live
more in memory than in hope; for the remnant of life is brief, but
what has passed is considerable; and hope indeed is of what is to
come; whereas memory is of things gone by. The very reason, this,
of their garrulity; for they never cease talking of that which has
taken place, since they are delighted in awakening the recollections
of things.</p>

<p>And their anger is keen, but faint. And some of their desires
have abandoned them. Others are faint; so that neither are they
liable to the influence of desire, nor apt to act in conformity to it,
but with a view to gain; on which account men of this age appear
to be naturally temperate, for both their desires have relaxed, and
they are enslaved to gain.</p>

<p>The old have moreover a tendency to pity, but not on the same
principle with the young; for the latter are thus disposed from their
love of human nature; the former from their imbecility. Whence
they are querulous, and neither facetious nor fond of mirth; for
querulousness is the very reverse of fondness for mirth. Such is
the disposition of those in advanced life.”—<span class="smcap">Theodore Buckley.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The writings of Aristotle exhausted the fields of art and
science; 400 treatises, most of which have perished, at one
time bore his name. Rhetoric, psychology or mental sci<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>ence,
and natural history, owed to him their origin. In his
“Organon” was first presented the method of <i>deduction</i>,—the
process by which the mind reasons down from general propositions
to particular cases, by means of the <i>syllogism</i>, the <i>organ</i>
or instrument of reasoning. Men had thus arrived at conclusions
for ages, without any knowledge of Aristotle’s formulæ,
just as they had talked correctly though ignorant of
analytical grammar. It was reserved for the Stagirite to discover
the laws by which they drew conclusions, and thus at
once to found and perfect <span class="smcap">Logic</span>. This was the science of
<i>reasoning</i>, as contrasted with Plato’s <i>dialectics</i> or method of
<i>discussing</i>. (<i>See Benn’s “The Greek Philosophers.”</i>)</p>

<p>Nor was Aristotle unacquainted with Induction, the great
lever of modern philosophy. This process, which reverses
the steps of deduction,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and reasons from particular cases up
to general laws, was employed in his researches, but was not
fully developed till twenty centuries later in the “Novum
Organon” of Lord Bacon, opening the way to a new era in
scientific investigation.</p>

<p>Aristotle willed his writings to his disciple Theophrastus,
whom we shall next consider; and for many years they were
kept from the world, while numerous imitations and forgeries
gained the popular ear through the prestige of Aristotle’s name.
It was not till 50 B.C. that a complete edition of the genuine
works was published, and then at Rome. Meanwhile the Lyceum
had waned; its later heads were men of mediocre ability,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and the Peripatetic School was superseded in popular estimation
by the Epicurean and the Stoic.</p>


<p><b>Theophrastus</b>, of Lesbos (374-287 B.C.), a pupil of Plato
and afterward of Aristotle, succeeded the latter, by his appointment,
as head of the Lyceum. During his time, he
maintained the high reputation of the school, attracting many
to it from all parts of Greece by his eloquence. That he
might address a still larger audience, he wrote numerous
treatises on philosophy and natural history.</p>

<p>His “Moral Characters,” which have descended to us,
show up in lively colors such representative personages as
the Gabbler, the Niggard, the Noodle, the Grumbler, the
Swell, the Poltroon, the Slanderer, the Newsmonger, the
Clown, etc., from whom, it seems, that Greek society was not
exempt any more than our own. These were the first character-sketches
ever made; they served as models to La
Bruyère in French, to Sir Thomas Overbury and others in
English literature. As specimens, we cull the most pointed
portions of the sections on the Flatterer and the Unseasonable
Man.</p>


<p class="center">THE FLATTERER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Flattery may be considered as a mode of companionship, degrading
but profitable to him who flatters.</p>

<p>The Flatterer is a person who will say as he walks with another,
‘Do you observe how people are looking at you? This happens to
no man in Athens but you. A compliment was paid to you yesterday
in the Porch. More than thirty persons were sitting there;
the question was started, Who is our foremost man? Every one
mentioned you first, and ended by coming back to your name.’</p>

<p>Then he will request the company to be silent while the great
man is speaking, and will praise him, too, in his hearing, and mark
his approbation at a pause with ‘True;’ or he will laugh at a frigid
joke, and stuff his cloak into his mouth as if he could not repress
his amusement.</p>

<p>He will request those whom he meets to stand still until ‘his
Honor’ has passed. He will buy apples and pears, and bring them
in, and give to the children in the father’s presence; adding, with
kisses, ‘Chicks of a good father.’ Also, when he assists at the pur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>chase
of slippers, he will declare that the foot is more shapely than
the shoe. If his patron is approaching a friend, he will run forward
and say, ‘He is coming to you;’ and then, turning back, ‘I have announced
you.’</p>

<p>He is the first of the guests to praise the wine; and to say, as he
reclines next the host, ‘How delicate is your fare! and (taking up
something from the table) ‘Now this—how excellent it is!’ He will
say that his patron’s house is well built, that his land is well planted,
and that his portrait is a good likeness.”—<span class="smcap">Jebb.</span></p>
</div>


<p class="center">MR. MALAPROP.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Unseasonable behavior is such a manner of conversation as is
very troublesome to those with whom you converse.</p>

<p>A man that acts unseasonably will intrude himself upon his friend,
when he is engaged in earnest business, and consult him about his
own private concerns. When his mistress lies dangerously ill of a
fever, he’ll make her a visit and carry himself gayly. If he stands in
need of a surety, he begs that favor of one who has just smarted for
being bound to another. If he is summoned for a witness in any
cause, he appears in court immediately after judgment has been given.</p>

<p>When he is invited to a wedding, he takes the opportunity to rail
at the fair sex. If he meets a friend who has just come home from a
long journey, he’ll press him to take a walk. He is ever ready and
punctual, as soon as a shop-keeper has sold his goods, to help him to
a customer that would have given more.</p>

<p>If he happens to be in a place where a servant is chastised, all the
comfort he gives him is to tell him that he also had formerly a boy
whom he chastised in the same manner, and that the poor lad so resented
this usage that he immediately made way with himself. If
he is accidentally present at an arbitration, where the contending
parties desire to have the matter in dispute between them amicably
settled, instead of promoting a reconciliation, he sets them together
by the ears, and makes the difference ten times greater than it was
before.”—<span class="smcap">Gally.</span></p>
</div>


<p><b>The Stoic School</b> was so called from the Painted Portico
(<i>stoa</i>) at Athens, where its founder <span class="smcap">Zeno</span>, the Cyprian, taught
for fifty-eight years (318-260 B.C.). It was based on high
moral principles, but was not free from errors. Duty was all
in this philosophy; virtue alone, happiness. Mastery of self,
contempt alike for pleasure and pain, were leading doctrines.</p>

<p>Fate governed the world, even God himself. Yet Zeno did
not allow this doctrine to excuse shortcomings or interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
with individual responsibility. When his slave, detected in
theft, besought exemption from chastisement on the plea that
it was fated for him to steal, he replied, “Yes, and it was also
fated for you to be flogged.”</p>

<p>Suicide, in Zeno’s creed, was justifiable when a man had
outlived his usefulness, and the great philosopher practised as
he preached; for, having received a severe fall at the age of
ninety-eight, he quietly remarked, “I obey the summons,” and
went and hanged himself.</p>

<p>Zeno enjoyed public confidence at home as well as the respect
of foreign princes; among his disciples were enrolled
some of the greatest men of Greece and Rome. Nothing remains
of his writings.</p>


<p><b>The Cynics</b> derived their name from the gymnasium of <i>Cyn</i>osarges,
near the Lyceum, where they gathered to listen to Antisthenes,
a pupil of Socrates. This extremist perverted his
master’s theory of virtue, which he made to consist in a comfortless
life, a renunciation of pleasure, and a contemptuous
and even shameless independence of manners. Yet Socrates
saw pride even through the holes of Antisthenes’ shabby robe.</p>

<p>Antisthenes was not much in metaphysics. He was puzzled
by abstract generalizations, and to Plato’s Idealism opposed
an uncompromising Realism. “Plato,” he said, “I can see a
horse, and I can see a man, but horsehood and manhood I
cannot see.”—“True,” replied Plato, “you have the eye that
can see a horse and a man; but the eye which can see horsehood
and manhood you lack.”</p>

<p>Of the many works of this first Cynic philosopher, scarcely
anything is left. They were probably steeped in gall, for his
powers of sarcasm were unsurpassed; he dealt trenchant
blows at what he considered folly, wherever he found it. He
ridiculed the want of judgment displayed at Athens in the
selection of generals, by counselling the Athenians to vote
their asses horses. “That is absurd,” was the reply. “No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
more so,” he retorted, “than to think you have made ignoramuses
generals, by simply lifting up the hand. “Once when
annoyed at a speaker’s dilating on the joys of the future state,
he abruptly demanded, “Why don’t you die, then?”</p>

<p>His successor, <span class="smcap">Diogenes</span>, carried out the rôle. Soured by
the disgraceful failure of his father, he turned to the ascetic
philosophy of the Cynics, and took a morbid pleasure in outraging
society by his infringements on decency. His satirical
remarks, which cut to the quick, earned him the title of “the
Dog” by way of eminence. He slept wherever he happened
to be, on stoops or in a tub; and eschewing artificial wants,
he felt so rebuked when he saw a boy drinking through his
hands and receiving his pottage in a hollowed loaf, that he
threw away his cup and platter.</p>

<p>Into such snarling, insolent, and offensive misanthropes did
the Cynics degenerate, that the name of their sect was popularly
traced to the <i>dogs</i> (in Greek <i>cynes</i>) they so much resembled.—To
this complexion did the noble philosophy of Socrates come at last.</p>


<h4>ORATORY.</h4>

<p><b>Political Eloquence</b>, like the drama, history, and philosophy,
attained perfection in the golden age. Public speaking was
a natural accomplishment of the Greeks; and from the days
of Homer down, soldiers, legislators, and statesmen, had been
distinguished as orators. In Pericles, who made eloquence a
study, we are introduced to one of the world’s most polished
speakers. (<i>Consult Jebb’s “Attic Orators.”</i>)</p>

<p>But the cultivation of rhetoric and oratory as an art was first
popularized by Gorgias of Leonti´ni (see Map, p. 304), who
about 427 B.C. transplanted it from Sicily and saw it flourish
in Athenian soil as it had never flourished before. Gorgias
founded a school of eloquence at Athens, which was thronged
by the great men of the time, eager to acquire the persuasive
arts of the Sicilian teacher. Thus rhetoric became a fashion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>able
accomplishment; and to such account was it turned by
the taste and genius of the Attic Greeks that they soon produced
the greatest orators of history.</p>

<p>Among these was the graceful and elegant <span class="smcap">Lysias</span> (<i>lish’e-ăs</i>—458-378
B.C.), compared by Quintilian to a pure fountain
rather than a great river; and <span class="smcap">Isæus</span>, the leading barrister of
Athens and preceptor of Demosthenes. Greater than either
as a teacher and writer of orations for others, though through
timidity he rarely appeared in public himself, was <span class="smcap">Isocrates</span>,
founder of a school from which Cicero said, “as from the
Trojan horse, princes only proceeded;” to use his own figure,
he was a whetstone which imparted the power of cutting to
other things, but cut not itself. Finally, to this category belonged
the great rivals Æschines and Demosthenes, foremost
of the Attic orators.</p>


<p><b>Demosthenes</b> (384-322 B.C.—it is worth remembering that
his dates are identical with Aristotle’s) stands alone in the
power of his eloquence. Born in Attica, he was left fatherless
at the age of seven, but inherited a large fortune. The bulk
of this his guardians made away with; although they engaged
the best talent in the land to superintend the education of their
ward. When Demosthenes arrived at his majority, he brought
suit against them, and wrote his maiden speeches with such
skill as to obtain a judgment in his favor.</p>

<p>The study of oratory now became the passion of his life.
By indomitable perseverance he overcame what to many would
have proved insuperable difficulties—shortness of breath, a
sickly constitution, a weak and stammering utterance, and
awkwardness in gesticulating. He practised on the sea-shore
till his voice rose clear and full above the breakers; he placed
pebbles in his mouth while declaiming to correct his articulation,
and improved his breathing by running up steep hills.
A friendly mirror helped him to make his gestures effective;
and he spent months at a time in a room underground, occu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>pied
in study, or in copying the history of Thucydides to
strengthen his style. Thus, in spite of every natural disadvantage,
he placed himself by his own efforts “at the head of
all mighty masters of speech.” He lived to receive the homage,
not only of those Athenians who had hissed the early
performances of “the stammerer,” but of crowds gathered
from all quarters of Greece.</p>

<p>Conciseness, precision, clearness, compact reasoning, power
of invective, and vehemence compared to that of a torrent
carrying everything before it, were characteristic of the orations
of Demosthenes. Sixty-one of these (probably not all
genuine) are still extant, the most famous being the twelve
“Philippics,” delivered against Philip of Macedon, who was
insidiously plotting the subversion of Grecian liberty. Demosthenes
penetrated his designs, disdained his bribes, and
for fourteen years struggled nobly against him. His impassioned
utterances at last roused the slumbering patriotism of
his countrymen, and, joined by the Thebans, they met Philip
at Chæronea—but only to be hopelessly defeated. The fate
of Greece was sealed. Demosthenes fled from the field and
escaped to Athens, where he delivered the funeral eulogy on
the slain.</p>

<p>The success of Philip strengthened the Macedonian sympathizers
in Athens, at the head of whom was the orator Æschines,
accused by Demosthenes of being in the pay of Macedon.
When, therefore, Ctesiphon proposed that the services of Demosthenes
be rewarded with a golden crown, Æschines opposed the measure.
After a delay of six years, during which
we may be sure both orators strained every nerve to prepare
for the decisive struggle, the final contest took place before a
vast and excited concourse. The fiery vigor of Demosthenes,
in the most splendid effort of ancient eloquence, swept away
like feathers the arguments, the wit, the sarcasm, of his opponent;
Æschines was utterly discomfited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>The elaborate speech “On the Crown” is the masterpiece
of Demosthenes; we give parts of the peroration.</p>


<p class="center">FROM DEMOSTHENES’ ORATION ON THE CROWN.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Do you then, Æschines, ask me for what merit I claim public
honors? I will tell you. It is because, when all the statesmen in
Greece had been corrupted, beginning with yourself, first by Philip
and then by Alexander, I was never induced nor tempted by opportunity,
nor by fair speeches, nor by the magnitude of proffered bribes,
nor by hope, nor by fear, nor by favor, nor by any other consideration,
to swerve a hair’s-breadth from the course which I believed to
be right and for the public good. Never, in weighing my public
counsels, have I, like you, inclined to the scale in which hung my
private advantage; but all that I have done has been done straightforwardly,
incorruptly, and with singleness of purpose. While I have
been charged with affairs of greater magnitude than any of my contemporaries,
the whole of my administration has been pure, honest,
disinterested. These are the grounds on which I claim to be honored.</p>

<p>As for the fortifications and intrenchments which you have sneered
at, I deem myself entitled to thanks and gratitude on that behalf.
Wherefore should I not? But I am far, indeed, from placing such
services in the same category with my general policy. It is not with
stones nor with bricks that I have fortified Athens; it is not upon
such works that I chiefly value myself; but if you would truly appreciate
my fortifications, you will find them in arms, cities, territories,
harbors, ships, and men to avail themselves of these advantages.
These are the outworks which I have thrown up before Attica, according
to the best of human foresight; by these have I fortified the
whole country, not merely the circuit of the Piræus and the city.
Nor was I defeated by the calculations or preparations of Philip; far
from it: but the generals and the forces of our allies were defeated
by Fortune. * * *</p>

<p>If my measures had been successful—O heaven and earth! we
must, beyond all question, have become a first-rate power, as we well
deserved to be. If they have failed, we have left to us our honor.
No reproach can attach to the state or to its policy, but Fortune must
bear the blame, who has so ordered our affairs. Never, never, will
the patriotic citizen desert his country’s cause, and, hiring himself
to her foes, watch his opportunities of injuring her; never will he
malign the statesman who in his utterances and his measures has
consistently maintained his country’s honor; nor will he nurse and
treasure up resentment for private wrongs; nor, lastly, will he
maintain a dishonest and a treacherous silence, as you have often
done. * * *</p>

<p>No part, Æschines, have you taken in any measure for strengthen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>ing
the country’s resources. What alliance has been ever obtained
for the state through your instrumentality? What succor? What
acquisition of good-will from others, or credit for ourselves? What
embassy? What public service that has added to our national renown?
What public affairs, whether domestic, Hellenic, or foreign,
have been brought by you to a successful issue? What ships have
you furnished? What arms? What dockyards? What fortifications?
What cavalry? In what one respect have you been useful?
What pecuniary contribution have you ever made upon public
grounds for the benefit of either the rich or the poor? None.</p>

<p>You were not deterred by your poverty, but by your anxiety to do
nothing opposed to the interests of those for whose benefit all your
policy has been designed. But what are the occasions of your brilliant
displays, the exhibition of your youthful vigor? When aught
is to be spoken against your countrymen, then is your voice best
tuned, then is your memory most accurate; then you act your part
to perfection. * * *</p>

<p>Every well-affected citizen, Athenians, (in such terms I am able to
speak of myself least invidiously) is bound to possess two qualities:
when in authority, the fixed resolve to maintain the honor and pre-eminence
of his country; under all circumstances and at all times,
loyalty. This Nature can command—to another power belong
strength and success. By this spirit you find me to have been uniformly
actuated.</p>

<p>Observe—never when I was demanded for extradition, nor when
Amphictyonic suits were prosecuted against me, nor when threats,
nor when promises were brought to bear upon me, nor when these
miscreants were let loose like wild beasts upon me—never was I induced
to abandon one jot or tittle of my loyalty to you. From first
to last I took the straight and true path of statesmanship—that of
complete devotion to the maintenance and furtherance of the honor,
the power, and the glory of my country. Never was I beheld strutting
about the Forum, radiant with joy and exultation at foreign
success, gesticulating congratulations to those who might be expected
to report them elsewhere. Nor have I heard the tidings of our
good fortune with dismay and lamentations, and prostration to the
earth, like these impious men who inveigh against their country
without perceiving that their invective is directed against themselves,
whose eyes are cast abroad, who felicitate themselves on
foreign success purchased by the calamities of Greece, and avow
their anxiety to secure its permanence.</p>

<p>Never, O ye Heavenly Powers! never may such designs obtain
favor at your hands! Rather, if it be possible, inspire even these
men with better thoughts, and turn their hearts; but if their moral
plague be incurable, cut them off from among us, and drive them
forth to destruction, sure and swift, over land and over sea: while
to us who are spared ye vouchsafe the speediest deliverance from our
impending alarms, and abiding security!”—<span class="smcap">Sir Robert Collier.</span></p>

<p>Twice after the reverse of Chæronea Demosthenes succeeded
in arraying his country against Macedon—at the
assassination of Philip and on the death of Alexander.
When news of Alexander’s decease reached Greece, the orator
was in exile, having been unjustly convicted of taking
Macedonian treasure; yet he did his utmost to arm the
Grecian cities, and was in consequence recalled to Athens
by the fickle people. But it was all in vain.</p>

<p>At last, marked for destruction by the Macedonian regent
Antip’ater, and doomed to death by his cowardly fellow-citizens
whose necks were now under the tyrant’s heel, he
fled to the temple of Neptune on Calaure’a and there found
relief from his troubles in a quill of poison which he kept
ready for an emergency. In Demosthenes, Athens lost an
incorruptible patriot—antiquity, one of her noblest characters.
The Athenians erected to his memory a brazen statue
on which was inscribed:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Had you for Greece been strong, as wise you were,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Macedonians had not conquered her.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><b>Æschines</b> (389-314 B.C.), of whose early life little is known,
after his defeat at the hands of Demosthenes, went into exile.
We are told that his victorious rival magnanimously forgave
him, and even offered him money for the journey; which led
Æschines to exclaim: “How I regret leaving a country
where I have found an enemy so generous that I must despair
of ever meeting with a friend who shall be like him!”</p>

<p>Æschines afterward established himself as a teacher of
oratory in Rhodes. Here he once repeated to his pupils his
famous oration against Ctesiphon in the contest for the crown,
which filled them with wonder that so able an orator should
have been defeated. But when at their request he read the
reply of Demosthenes, his audience rose to their feet with
eager acclamations; and the orator, forgetting all jealousy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
his admiration, cried: “What would you have said, had you
heard the wild beast himself roaring it out?”</p>

<p>The oration against Ctesiphon is one of three familiarly
known in antiquity as “the Three Graces”—a title indicative
of the refinement and easy flow of the author’s style, deficient
as it was in the energy and vehemence of his great rival.</p>

<h4>NOTES ON GREEK EDUCATION, ETC.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Education recognized as all-important in ancient Greece, and even made compulsory
by the great lawgivers. In Homer’s time, children taught obedience,
respect for the aged, and modesty of deportment; sons instructed in the use of
weapons and gymnastic exercises; daughters, in domestic economy and virtue.
Homer’s epics long the chief text-books on all subjects.</p>

<p>Reading and writing, accomplishments of the earliest periods. An ignorant
Greek an anomaly. Even among the Spartans, who affected contempt for lit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>erature,
reading and writing were practised. The magistrates and their officers
were provided with wooden cylinders of the same size; when one desired to
communicate, he wound a strip of parchment round his cylinder and wrote his
message thereon; then, removing the strip, he sent it to the other party, who
was enabled to read it by rolling it upon his own cylinder in the same folds.</p>

<p>In the golden age, common schools were the glory of Greece; the rudiments
of education everywhere taught. The importance of grammar urged by Plato,
who was the first to explain the difference between nouns and verbs; articles and
conjunctions distinguished by Aristotle, and also differences of number and case.
The foundation of scientific grammar laid by the Stoics, who recognized eight
parts of speech. Those who could afford it completed their education at the
Lyceum, Academy, or some other celebrated school, often paying most extravagantly
for instruction in rhetoric and philosophy. Some teachers charged their
pupils as much as $2,000 apiece for a course of lectures. Foreign languages
were never studied by the Greeks.</p>

<p>Many private libraries were established during the golden age, but no circulating
or public libraries. As early as 400 B.C. Athens carried on quite a trade
in manuscripts, one quarter of the market-place being called “the book-mart.”
Books were generally abundant and cheap, being copied by slaves, but rare
works were very costly. Plato paid $1,600 for three books. (<i>The reader is referred
to Becker’s “Charicles; or, Illustrations of the Private Life of the Ancient
Greeks.”</i>)</p>

<p>Wooden tablets for accounts sold for 18 cts. each about 400 B.C. A small blank
book of two wax tablets was worth less than a penny. Pencils are said to have
been invented 408 B.C. by Apollodorus, the self-styled “Prince of Painters.”</p>

<small><i>THE ALEXANDRIAN PERIOD.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Decline of Letters.</b>—The triumph of the Doric states over
Athens in the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) gave the
first blow to the intellectual power of Greece. Literary decay
forthwith set in; its progress was hastened by internal
dissensions, and completed when liberty was hopelessly extinguished
by Philip of Macedon and his successors.</p>

<p>Alexander indeed benefited the East by introducing the
Greek language and culture, and building magnificent cities
in return for her hordes of barbarians slain; but his policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
left out of view the interests of Greece. While Athens remained
the seminary of Europe for several centuries after his
death, Alexandria, founded by him at the mouth of the Nile,
became the intellectual as well as commercial capital of the
world. From this city, the period we are about to consider
derives its name. It extends from the death of Alexander
the Great (323 B.C.) to the conquest of Egypt by the Romans
(30 B.C.).</p>

<p><b>The Alexandrian Age</b> produced no grand masterpieces.
No glorious struggle for freedom inspired the historian; there
was no further need for the efforts of the orator; science and
criticism flourished instead of poetry; and a host of imitators
usurped the place of the mighty originals of the olden time.
The national taste had sadly deteriorated; an affected obscurity
was fashionable; and gaudy tinsel was more highly
valued than true gold.</p>

<p>Yet one bright bloom gladdened this waste—Idyllic Poetry,
which expanded into a perfect flower in the hands of
Theoc’ritus the Sicilian. A new school of comedy was also
established by Menander and Phile’mon; and many seeds of
Greek genius that Alexander had scattered broadcast over
the earth sprung up on foreign soil, and yielded fruit—but
fruit inferior to that ripened under its native sun.</p>


<h4>DRAMATIC POETRY.</h4>


<p><b>The New Comedy</b> dealt with the follies and vices of society
at large, not with individuals, the actor no longer venturing,
since the downfall of political liberty, to imitate Aristophanes
in representing living characters. Its simple plot was generally
based on some love-intrigue. Though the broad fun of
the Old Comedy was wanting, quiet humor contrasted happily
with pathos, the grave with the gay; the audience, provoked
by turns to laughter and to tears, were all the time
learning some useful principle or moral lesson. Cicero styled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the New Comedy “the mirror of real life.”—The chorus now
ceased to take part in the representation, and the play was
divided into acts separated by intervals of time.</p>

<p>Of the sixty-four poets associated by the ancients with the
New Comedy, the greatest were Menander and Philemon,
both citizens of Athens, though Philemon was foreign-born.
Not until both had passed from the stage of life was the
meed of superior excellence awarded to Menander.</p>


<p><b>Menander</b> (341-291 B.C.) dramatized love-stories for the
young with elegance and dignity; while the undercurrent of
wisdom that flowed through his plays recommended them to
the old. Out of a hundred comedies of which he was the author,
only a few fragments are left; but these Goethe pronounced
“invaluable.” So perfectly did he delineate character
that Aristophanes, the grammarian, asked whether Menander
copied life, or life Menander.</p>

<p>His talent early displayed itself, securing him a crown
while he was yet a mere youth, but subjecting him to the displeasure
of his defeated rivals, who accused him of presumption
in vying with experienced poets. Menander replied to
the charge by appearing on the stage with an armful of new-born
puppies, which he cast into a tub of water. Bidding the
audience mark how they swam, he exclaimed: “You ask me,
Athenians, how at my years I can have the knowledge of life
required in the dramatist; I ask you under what master and
in what school these creatures learned to swim?”</p>

<p>Despite his superior merit, however, Menander obtained
the dramatic prize but eight times, owing to the greater influence
of his rival Philemon with the masses. It is stated that
this injustice at length led the poet to drown himself. His
plays long served as models to the comic stage. The Romans,
Plautus and Terence, helped themselves freely from his
treasury, and through their dramas our modern comedy may
be traced back to Menander himself.</p>

stooped to unworthy means to defeat his opponent;
still, that his countrymen really admired him is evident from
the legend current of his death. As he was concluding a
comedy in his ninety-ninth year, nine beautiful maidens were
said to have entered his chamber and beckoned him away.
They were the Muses, about to wing their flight from Athens
forever, and with them departed the soul of Philemon—the

<h4>PASTORAL POETRY.</h4>


<p><b>Theocritus</b> (flourished 283-263 B.C.).—The pastoral, or
bucolic, poetry of the Greeks, which originated in the rude
songs of Laconian and Sicilian shepherds, was matured and elevated
into a new department of polite composition in the idyls
of Theocritus. Born in Sicily, as he tells us in an epigram
intended to preface his works, he was tempted to the court of
Ptolemy Philadelphus. Here his refreshing pictures of rural
scenery were the delight of the Alexandrians, shut in by the
walls of their city from the beauties of nature. Theocritus
eventually returned to Sicily, and ended his days amid his native
fields. (<i>Symonds’s “Studies of the Greek Poets,” p. 302.</i>)</p>

<p>The poetry of Theocritus exhibits originality and refinement,
the Doric dialect in which he wrote lending the charm
of picturesqueness to his descriptions. Pope commends him
for simplicity and truthfulness to nature; Dryden, for “the
inimitable tenderness of his passions” and the skill with
which he disguised his art. As a delineator of natural scenery,
he has no superior among ancient or modern poets.—There
are extant thirty idyls and twenty-two epigrams of
this poet. We present below Idyl VIII.</p>

<p><b>Bion</b> of Smyrna, a contemporary of Theocritus, emigrated
to Sicily for the purpose of studying pastoral poetry in its native
haunts. What little we know respecting his life is gathered
from the elegy written by his pupil, the delicate and
graceful <span class="smcap">Moschus</span>, a bucolic poet of Syracuse ranked with
Theocritus and Bion, but inferior to both. “The Lament for
Bion” intimates that he died from the effects of poison, administered
perhaps by jealous rivals.</p>

<p>Bion’s love-songs and pastorals are characterized by sweetness
and finish; they are less life-like, however, than those of

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">A young bird-catcher sat ’neath a wide-spreading tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where the breath of the summer breeze sported free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Looking round on the neighboring bushes with care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To see if a songster were lingering there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At length, in the distance, he something espies—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A creature with wings of unusual size—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Aha! what a treasure!” he joyously cries;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“To catch such a bird would indeed be a prize!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then sets to work with his rods all together,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take the huge bird without spoiling a feather.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">But the creature, alarmed, from its perch quickly flew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The boy, all excited, still kept it in view</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till it lit on a box-tree—then followed his prey;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Alas! with a cry, it again flew away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At length he grew tired of this profitless chase,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And turned toward his home with a wearisome pace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But ere long, on the road, an old farmer he met,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who had taught him his snares for the songsters to set.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he told how the bird all his skill had evaded,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to go see this wonder the farmer persuaded.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">At length they drew near; in a thicket of trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose tops gently waved in the murmuring breeze,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">In beauty bewitching, there sat errant Love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His pinions hung prettily down by his side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And his features, the Cyprian goddess’s pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were as lovely as ever, more roguish by half,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For he scarce could refrain from a boisterous laugh.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as soon as he saw him, the husbandman, smiling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knew at once the young Love-god the boy was beguiling.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Then said he to the boy: “Quick, away from this grove:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The bird thou art seeking is mischievous Love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though brilliant his hues as the butterfly’s wings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And melody dwells on the strain that he sings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet a dangerous prize to the catcher he’ll prove.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then away with thy bird-lime, nor follow this Love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When he flies, seize thy chance and escape if thou can,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For in vain wilt thou shun him when grown to a man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then thou’lt be the bird—he, the catcher,’ll pursue thee;</div>

<p><b>The Museum.</b>—While the Muses who fled with the spirit of
Philemon were never induced to return to Hellas, in the East
the Greek mind, stimulated by the architectural wonders, the
new religious systems, the proficiency in many departments
of knowledge, which it encountered, entered upon a new phase
of development. Alexandria witnessed its proudest achievements
in science.</p>

<p>This city was embellished with temples and palaces, with
parks, fountains, and monuments, until it eclipsed in beauty
all others of its time. Our interest, however, centres in its
marble Muse’um, or Temple of the Muses, begun by the first
Ptolemy and finished by his son Philadelphus, which sent forth
the greatest scientists of antiquity. In its halls, those hungering
for knowledge were more than satisfied; up and down its
corridors the professors walked as they gave instruction; while
its botanical and zoölogical gardens afforded opportunities for
delightful relaxation. An observatory and the best astronomical
instruments of the day invited to the study of the heavens,
and a dissecting-room was at the disposal of the anatomist.
Chemical investigations were facilitated by a laboratory, where
thus early the science of alchemy was born, and Philadelphus
himself eagerly experimented in search of the elixir of life.
To this brilliant centre of letters, the first university in the
world, learned men were attracted from all quarters. At one
time, 14,000 students were under instruction.</p>


<p><b>The Alexandrian Library.</b>—The Museum was the seat of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
great library, collected in accordance with Ptolemy’s command
that all the writings of the earth should be brought to Egypt
to be transcribed. But once there, the originals seldom parted
company with the pictures and statues in Ptolemy’s sculptured
alcoves, the owners being obliged to content themselves with
fac-similes of their treasured rolls made by the royal copyists.
The Egyptian kings often paid roundly for valuable manuscripts.
It is stated that Philadelphus borrowed at Athens
the plays of Euripides to have them copied for his library,
depositing about $10,000 as security for their return. But
when the work was done, he sent back the transcript, preferring
to lose his money rather than part with the originals.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Greeks of the Alexandrian Period.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>Philadelphus left 100,000 volumes in the library. These
quadrupled after his death, and filled the Museum to overflowing,
so that in the Temple of Sera’pis was opened “the
Daughter Library” for the reception of additional volumes.
The number of these ultimately reached 300,000, making
700,000 in all.</p>

<p>When, after the assassination of Pompey, Cæsar fired Alexandria
(47 B.C.), the flames enwrapped the Museum, and its
library perished. Antony subsequently gave Cleopatra the
Pergamene Collection of parchment books (see p. 24), which,
with his kingdom, Attalus III. had bequeathed to the Romans
(133 B.C.). This, added to the rolls in the Temple of Serapis,
formed at once an extensive library. It was increased
by constant additions, but in the end served as fuel for the
four thousand baths of the city, when Alexandria fell before
the Mohammedan arms (640 A.D.), and the bigoted caliph
decided that “if the Greek writings agreed with the Koran,
they were useless and need not be preserved; if they disagreed,
they were pernicious and ought to be destroyed.”</p>


<h4>POETRY AT ALEXANDRIA.</h4>

<p>The first school of poetry at Alexandria was founded by
Phile’tas (330-285 B.C.), the elegiac writer, so dwarfish and
emaciated that the jesters of his time declared he had to
wear leaden shoes to keep the wind from blowing him away.
Philetas was the instructor of Theocritus. But the greatest
names associated with the Museum are those of Callim’achus
and Apollonius Rhodius.</p>


<p><b>Callimachus</b> (250 B.C.) shines not only as a lyric and epic
poet, but also as a critic and grammarian. From the position
of a suburban schoolmaster he rose to that of librarian at the
Museum, and made himself “the literary dictator and universal
genius of his age.”</p>

<p>Callimachus exercised his talents in all the departments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
poetry, and wrote as well in prose. His works reached the
number of 800; which is not to be wondered at when we remember
his remark, “A great book is a great evil.” Such of
his hymns and epigrams as time has spared, bear the marks
of study rather than genius.</p>


<p><b>Apollonius</b>, called <b>Rhodius</b> from his long residence in
Rhodes, was born at Alexandria, and studied under Callimachus.
But the master grew jealous of his pupil, and a
quarrel arose between them. When, at the instigation of
Callimachus, his epic poem on the Argonautic Expedition
was unfavorably received by the Alexandrians, Apollonius, in
his mortification, left the city and opened a school of rhetoric
in Rhodes. Here he revised his poem, and became justly
renowned for his brilliant attainments. After the death of
Callimachus, he was recalled to Alexandria, read his epic a
second time to the people, and had the satisfaction of receiving
their warmest commendations with the honorable office
of librarian (194 B.C.).</p>

<p>The “Argonautica,” in four books, is all that is left of his
works. We take from it the passage which describes the
impression made on Medea by Jason, the leader of the expedition;
compare the history of Medea as sketched in
connection with the play of Euripides bearing her name,
page 210.</p>

<h4>PROSE WRITERS.</h4>


<p><b>Science.</b>—The influence of the Alexandrian university in
shaping modern science was all-potential. Among its ornaments
are numbered the mathematicians Euclid and Archime’des,
the astronomer Eratos’thenes, Hero the inventor
of a steam-engine, and Ctesibius who devised water-clocks,
pumps, and other ingenious machines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Euclid</span> (300 B.C.) compressed in one volume all the geometrical
knowledge extant, adding several original theorems.
His “Elements” has been translated into many languages,
and though it has attained the venerable age of 2,200 years,
its clear demonstrations are still standards in our schools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archimedes</span> was educated in Alexandria, but afterward
lived in Syracuse, where his mathematical genius challenged
the admiration of the world. In geometry and mechanics he
was the master-mind of antiquity; and until the star of Newton
rose twenty centuries after, Europe saw not his equal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
Many important discoveries in physical science are due to
Archimedes,—the principle of the lever, which led him to
exclaim, “Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the
world;” the process of finding the specific gravity of bodies;
the hydraulic screw and the pulley. Of his many mathematical
works, written in Doric Greek, eight survive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eratosthenes</span> (276-196 B.C.) was the founder of geodesy
and chronology, as well as a proficient in astronomy, grammar,
and poetry. The ancients styled him <i>Pentathlos</i> (<i>quintuple
athlete</i>); also, from his determining the magnitude of
the earth, “Measurer of the Universe.” His most important
works are “Chronographies,” and geographical and mathematical
writings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hipparchus</span> (150 B.C.), an astronomer of the Alexandrian
age, deserves mention as the inventor of the planisphere and
as the first to make a catalogue of the stars. He devised the
method of locating places by latitude and longitude.</p>


<p><b>Grammar.</b>—The Museum was especially eminent as a
school of grammar and criticism, the principal occupation of
its scholars being the revision and correction of the texts of
the old authors.</p>

<p>The most distinguished of the Alexandrian critics were—<span class="smcap">Zenod’otus</span>,
the first librarian and critical editor of Homer’s
epics; <span class="smcap">Aristophanes of Byzantium</span>, his pupil (200 B.C.),
the inventor of Greek accents and punctuation; <span class="smcap">Aristarchus</span>
(156 B.C.), “the arch-grammarian of Greece,” who
divided Homer’s poems into books, revised the Alexandrian
canon, and was the author of 800 commentaries; and <span class="smcap">Cra’tes</span>,
head of a grammatical school at Pergamus, and the first
to make grammar a popular study at Rome.</p>


<p><b>History.</b>—<span class="smcap">Polybius</span> (204-122 B.C.) was the chief historian
of the Alexandrian age. Brought to Rome a prisoner after
the battle of Pydna (168 B.C.), in which the king of Macedon
was overthrown by Paulus Æmilius, he became the intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
friend of Scipio Africanus the Younger. Seventeen years
elapsed before Polybius was permitted to return to Greece.
Then he went back the firm friend of the Romans; and had
his countrymen heeded his counsels, the sack of Corinth
might have been averted and Greece might have preserved
her independence. So, at least, declared the inscription on
his statue: “Hellas would have been saved had she followed
the advice of Polybius.”</p>

<p>Polybius accompanied Scipio in several of his campaigns,
and saw Carthage burned to the ground. In his travels,
which were varied and extensive, he stored his mind with
useful information for his “Universal History,” the grand
work of his life. Its forty books impartially narrated the
history of Rome and the contemporary nations between the
years 220 and 146 B.C., but in a style devoid of attractions.
Polybius, as Macaulay said, lacked “the art of telling a story
in an interesting manner.” The first five books of his work,
and a few fragments of the others, have been preserved.</p>

<p>As all eyes have recently been turned on Constantinople,
whose important situation has long made its acquisition the
traditional policy of Russia, it may not be uninteresting to
present the view which Polybius takes of this ancient city,
then known as</p>


<p class="center">BYZANTIUM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Byzantium, of all the cities in the world, is the most happy in
its situation with respect to the sea, being not only secure on that
side from all enemies, but possessed also of the means of obtaining
every kind of necessaries in the greatest plenty. But with respect
to the land, there is scarcely any place that has so little claim to
these advantages.</p>

<p>With regard to the sea, the Byzantines, standing close upon the
entrance of the Euxine, command so absolutely all that passage that
it is not possible for any merchant to sail through it, or return, without
their permission; and hence they are the masters of all those
commodities which are drawn in various kinds from the countries
that lie round this sea, to satisfy the wants or conveniences of other
men. For among the things that are necessary for use, they supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
the Greeks with leather, and with great numbers of very serviceable
slaves. And with regard to those that are esteemed conveniences,
they send honey and wax, with all kinds of seasoned and salted
meats; taking from us in exchange our own superfluous commodities,
oil and every sort of wine. They sometimes also furnish us
with corn, and sometimes receive it from us, as the wants of either
may require.</p>

<p>Now it is certain that the Greeks must either be excluded wholly
from this commerce, or be deprived at least of all its chief advantages,
if ever the Byzantines should engage in any ill designs against
them. For as well by reason of the extreme narrowness of the passage
as from the numbers of barbarians that are settled around it,
we should never be able to gain an entrance through it into the
Euxine.</p>

<p>Though the Byzantines, therefore, are themselves possessed of the
first and best advantages of this happy situation, which enables
them to make both an easy and a profitable exchange of their superfluous
commodities, and to procure in return, without any pain or
danger, whatever their own lands fail to furnish; yet since, through
their means chiefly, other countries also are enabled to obtain many
things that are of the greatest use, it seems reasonable that they
should always be regarded by the Greeks as common benefactors,
and receive not only favor and acknowledgments, but assistance
likewise to repel all attempts that may be made against them by
their barbarous neighbors.</p>

<p>And with these barbarous tribes they are involved in constant
war. For when they have taken great pains to cultivate their
lands, which are by nature very fertile, and the rich fruits stand
ready to repay their labors, on a sudden the barbarians, pouring
down, destroy one part and carry away the rest; and leave to the
Byzantines, after all their cost and toil, only the pain of beholding
their best harvests wasted, while their beauty aggravates the grief,
and renders the sense of their calamity more sharp and insupportable.”—<span class="smcap">Hampton.</span></p>

into many different tongues.</p>

<small><i>LATER GREEK LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Extinction of Greek Genius.</b>—The long period which now
engages our attention is marked by a further decline, and the
ultimate extinction of letters. Roman despotism was inimical
to literature; Greece lay prostrate and broken-spirited; night
was fast settling down on the world. Poetry, a faint shadow
of its former self, appeared principally in epigrams. The
prose of the early Christian centuries exhibits some exceptional
gleams, but they are only the flickerings of a dying
flame.</p>

<p>About the Christian Era is gathered a group of geographical
and historical writers with Stra’bo, Diodo’rus Sic’ulus,
and Dionysius of Halicarnassus as the prominent figures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
The first century after Christ presents to us the authors of
the New Testament; Clement of Rome, an eminent authority
with the early Christians; and Josephus, the Jewish historian,
all of whom wrote in Greek. Plutarch, the eminent biographer,
born about 50 A.D., lived through the first twenty years
of the second century, which was also adorned with the names
of Lucian and Pausanias the geographer. In the third century
flourished Longi’nus, the greatest rhetorician of this later
age; while the writings of the Christian fathers extend over a
period of several hundred years, from the time of Clement
just named.</p>

<p>After the fall of Rome (476 A.D.), Constantinople became
the sole centre of letters, and there for nearly a thousand
years they languished. After Mahomet II. carried the city
by storm in 1453, the native scholars dispersed over Europe,
and by awakening an interest in classical studies contributed
not a little to the revival of letters.</p>


<h4>THE FIRST CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST.</h4>

<p><b>Diodorus Siculus</b> (<i>the Sicilian</i>) was the author of “the Historical
Library,” which cost him thirty years of labor. Unfolding
the story of the human race from remote antiquity to
the time of Julius Cæsar, his work contains much valuable
information.</p>

<p><b>Dionysius of Halicarnassus.</b>—The longest production of
this writer is his “Roman Antiquities,” a history of Rome
prior to the Punic wars, pervaded by an evident partiality for
Greece and her institutions. Dionysius was also a rhetorician
of the highest rank, as his critical essays on the eloquence
of Demosthenes, the style of Thucydides, and other subjects,
testify.</p>

<p><b>Strabo</b>, of Pontus in Asia Minor, must be remembered in
connection with his “Geography,” still extant, an interesting
work in seventeen books, for which he prepared himself by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
travels in Asia, Africa, and Europe. It is not a mere tissue
of names and statistics, but is lighted up with sketches of social
life, pleasant stories, and epitomes of political history,
thus entertaining at the same time that it instructs.</p>

<p>What this lively writer records of India may interest the
reader:—</p>


<p class="center">THE WONDERS OF INDIA.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Between the Hydaspes and the Acesi’nes is the country of Porus,
an extensive and fertile district, containing nearly three hundred
cities. Here also is the forest in which Alexander cut down a large
quantity of fir, pine, cedar, and a variety of other trees fit for shipbuilding,
and brought the timber down the Hydaspes. With this he
constructed a fleet near the cities which he built on each side of the
river, where he had crossed it and conquered Porus. One of these
cities he called Bucephalia, from the horse Bucephalus, which was
killed in the battle with Porus. The name Bucephalus (<i>ox-headed</i>)
was given to the animal from the breadth of his forehead.</p>

<p>In the forest before mentioned it is said there is a vast number of
monkeys, as large as they are numerous. On one occasion the Macedonians,
seeing a body of them standing in array on some bare eminences,
prepared to attack them as real enemies.</p>

<p>The chase of this animal is conducted in two different ways. The
hunters, when they perceive a monkey seated on a tree, place in
sight a basin containing water, with which they wash their own
eyes; then, instead of water, they put a basin of bird-lime, go away,
and lie in wait at a distance. The animal, being an imitative creature,
leaps down, and besmears itself with the bird-lime, and when it
winks, the eyelids are fastened together. The hunters then come
upon it, and take it. The other method of capturing them is as follows:
the hunters dress themselves in bags like trousers and go
away, leaving behind them others which are downy, with the inside
smeared over with bird-lime. The monkeys put them on, and are
easily taken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very singular usage is related of the high estimation in which
the inhabitants of Cathaia (the tract between the Hydaspes and
Acesines) hold the quality of beauty. They elect the handsomest
person as king. A child, two months after birth, undergoes a public
inspection. They determine whether it has the amount of beauty
required by law. The presiding magistrate then pronounces whether it
is to be allowed to live, or to be put to death. The bride and
the husband are respectively the choice of each other, and the wives,
it is related, burn themselves with their deceased husbands. The
reason assigned for this practice is, that the women sometimes fell
in love with young men, and deserted or poisoned their husbands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
This law was therefore established in order to check the practice of
administering poison; but neither the existence nor the origin of
the law is probable.</p>

<p>The dogs in this territory are said to possess remarkable courage.
Alexander received from Sopeithes, the monarch, a present of one hundred
and fifty of them. To prove them, two were set at a lion; when
these were mastered, two others were set on; when the battle became equal,
Sopeithes ordered a man to seize one of the dogs by the
leg, and to drag him away; or to cut off his leg, if he still held on.
Alexander at first refused his consent to the dog’s leg being cut off,
as he wished to save the dog. But on Sopeithes saying, ‘I will give
you four in the place of it,’ Alexander consented; and he saw the dog
permit his leg to be cut off by a slow incision rather than loose his
hold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nearchus is surprised at the multitude and the noxious nature of
the reptiles. They retreat from the plains to the settlements at the
period of inundations, and fill the houses. For this reason the inhabitants
raise their beds from the ground, and are sometimes compelled
to abandon their dwellings. Charmers go about the country, and
are supposed to cure wounds made by serpents. This seems to comprise
nearly their whole art of medicine, for disease is not frequent
among them, owing to their frugal manner of life, and to the absence
of wine. Whenever diseases do occur, they are treated by the Sophists
(<i>wise men</i>).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the Indians are frugal in their mode of life, and are happy on
account of their simple manners. They never drink wine but at sacrifices.
Their beverage is made from rice instead of barley, and their
food consists for the most part of rice pottage. The simplicity of
their laws appears from their having few lawsuits. Theft is very
rare among them. Their houses and property are unguarded. These
things denote temperance and sobriety. Others of their customs no
one would approve; as their eating always alone, and their not having
all of them one common hour for their meals, but each taking
food as he likes. As an exercise of the body they prefer friction in
various ways, but particularly by making use of smooth sticks of
ebony, which they pass over the surface of the skin. They marry
many wives, who are purchased from their parents, and give in exchange
for them a yoke of oxen.</p>

<p>Megasthenes divides the philosophers into two kinds, the Brahmans
and the Garmanes. The Brahmans are held in greater repute.
They do not communicate their philosophy to their wives, for fear
they should divulge to the profane anything which ought to be concealed.
They discourse much on death, and discipline themselves to
prepare for it. According to the Brahmans, the world was created
and is liable to corruption; it is of a spheroidal figure; the god who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
made and governs it, pervades the whole of it; the earth is situated
in the centre of the universe. Many other peculiar things they say
of the principles of generation and of the soul. They invent fables
also, after the manner of Plato, on immortality and on the punishment
in Hades; and other things of this kind.”—<span class="smcap">Falconer.</span></p>

<h4>THE FIRST THREE CHRISTIAN CENTURIES.</h4>

<p><b>Josephus</b>, born A.D. 37 at Jerusalem, was the scion of a
noble line. At the early age of fourteen he astonished the
chief priests by his mental power and familiarity with the intricacies
of Jewish law. We next hear of him as spending
three years in the desert with a hermit, and then as joining
the Pharisees.</p>

<p>The revolutionary tendencies of his countrymen brought on
a war with the Romans, in the course of which Josephus, after
the brave defence of a city under his command, was made
prisoner by the Roman general Flavius Vespasian. Prophesying
that Vespasian would one day wear the purple of the
emperors, he alone of the captives was spared; the fulfilment
of this prediction about three years later insured him the favor
of the Flavian family, whose name he prefixed to his own.
Vespasian’s son, Titus, he accompanied to the siege of Jerusalem,
receiving at the hands of the victorious general after its
capture the lives of two hundred and forty of his friends, together
with the sacred volumes which he greatly prized.</p>

<p>From the desolation of his country, Josephus returned to
Rome as the honored guest of the emperor and his sons, during
whose reigns he produced his great works,—“the History
of the Jewish War” and “Jewish Antiquities.” These interesting
standards, though written in a style which has led to
their author’s being called “the Grecian Livy,” are yet tinged
with vanity and skepticism.</p>


<p><b>Plutarch</b> (50-120 A.D.), the great biographer of antiquity,
was born in Chæronea, a Bœotian town. After completing
his education at Athens, he sailed to Egypt, and in Domitian’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
reign (81-96 A.D.) visited Rome, where his lectures won golden
opinions from the learned.</p>

<p>From Italy, Plutarch returned to his native city, and there
passed the last twenty or thirty years of his life, happy in the
society of his wife, a paragon of good sense, economy, and virtue.
Literature was henceforth his pursuit; but believing it
a duty to devote part of his time to the public good, he accepted
office from his fellow-townsmen, and was finally made
chief-magistrate of Chæronea. He tells us with relish how
his neighbors often laughed at his doing what they considered
beneath his dignity. When they wondered that so great a
man should carry fish from market in his own hands, he told
them, “Why, it’s for myself;” and when they found fault with
him for personally superintending the building of public edifices,
he silenced them with the reply, “This service is not for
myself, but for my country.” “The meaner the office you
sustain,” said Plutarch, “the greater the compliment you pay
to the public.”</p>

<p>In his delightful retreat at Chæronea, Plutarch compiled
from two hundred and fifty authorities the work that has given
him a niche in the Temple of Fame—“Parallel Lives”—sparkling
with interest and animation, as it is underlaid by
good judgment. His plan was to present the biography of a
distinguished Greek, follow it with that of some Roman, and
then critically compare the two characters. But the “Lives,”
as we have it, is not the complete work its author probably
left at his death, inasmuch as a number of biographies and
parallels are wanting. Though Plutarch’s passion for story-telling
sometimes carries him beyond the bounds of the probable,
yet his work is an invaluable storehouse; his capital
literary portraits have stood the test of time, and are still
universally admired. The charms of a book in which are
recorded “the greatest characters and most admirable actions
of the human race” can never fade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>


<p>Among the best of Plutarch’s Parallels is his</p>


<p class="center">COMPARISON OF DEMOSTHENES AND CICERO.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Omitting an exact comparison of their respective faculties in
speaking, yet thus much seems fit to be said: That Demosthenes, to
make himself a master in rhetoric, applied all the faculties he had,
natural or acquired, wholly that way; that he far surpassed in force
and strength of eloquence all his contemporaries in political and
judicial speaking, in grandeur and majesty all the panegyrical orators,
and in accuracy and science all the logicians and rhetoricians of his
day: That Cicero was highly educated, and by his diligent study
became a most accomplished general scholar in all these branches,
having left behind him numerous philosophical treatises of his own
on Academic principles; as, indeed, even in his written speeches,
both political and judicial, we see him continually trying to show
his learning by the way.</p>

<p>One may discover the different temper of each of them in their
speeches. For the oratory of Demosthenes was without any embellishment
or jesting, wholly composed for real effect and seriousness;
not smelling of the lamp, as Pytheas scoffingly said, but of the temperance,
thoughtfulness, austerity, and grave earnestness of his temper.
Whereas Cicero’s fondness for mockery often ran him into
scurrility; and in his love of laughing away serious arguments in
judicial cases by jests and facetious remarks, with a view to the
advantage of his clients, he paid too little regard to what was decent:
saying, for example, in his defence of Cælius, that he had done no
absurd thing in indulging himself so freely in pleasures, it being a
kind of madness not to enjoy the things we possess, especially since
the most eminent philosophers have asserted pleasure to be the chief
good. So also we are told that when Cicero, being consul, undertook
the defence of Murena against Cato’s prosecution, by way of bantering
Cato, he made a long series of jokes upon the absurd <i>paradoxes</i>,
as they are called, of the Stoic sect; so that, a loud laugh passing
from the crowd to the judges, Cato, with a quiet smile, said to those
who sat next him, ‘My friends, what an amusing consul we have!’</p>

<p>Cicero was by natural temper very much disposed to mirth and
pleasantry, and always appeared with a smiling and serene countenance.
But Demosthenes had constant care and thoughtfulness
in his look, and a serious anxiety, which he seldom, if ever, laid aside;
and, therefore, he was accounted by his enemies, as he himself confessed,
morose and ill-mannered.</p>

<p>It is very evident, also, from their several writings, that Demosthenes
never touched upon his own praises but decently and without
offence when there was need of it, and for some weightier end; but,
upon other occasions, modestly and sparingly. But Cicero’s immeasurable
boasting of himself in his orations argues him guilty of an
uncontrollable appetite for distintion, his cry being evermore that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
arms should give place to the gown, and the soldier’s laurel to the
tongue. And at last we find him extolling not only his deeds and
actions, but his orations also, as well those that were only spoken as
those that were published; as if he were engaged in a boyish trial
of skill, who should speak best, with the rhetoricians Isocrates and
Anaximenes, not as one who could claim the task to guide and instruct
the Roman nation, the</p>

<p class="center">
Soldier full-armed, terrific to the foe.<br />
</p>

<p>Moreover, the banishment of Demosthenes was infamous, upon conviction
for bribery; Cicero’s very honorable, for ridding his country
of a set of villains. Therefore when Demosthenes fled his country,
no man regarded it; for Cicero’s sake, the senate changed their habit
and put on mourning, and would not be persuaded to make any act
before Cicero’s return was decreed.</p>

<p>Cicero, however, passed his exile idly in Macedonia. But the very
exile of Demosthenes made up a great part of the services he did for
his country; for he went through the cities of Greece, and everywhere,
as we have said, joined in the conflict on behalf of the Grecians, driving
out the Macedonian ambassadors, and approving himself a much
better citizen than Themistocles and Alcibiades did in the like fortune.
After his return, he again devoted himself to the same public
service, and continued firm in his opposition to Antipater and the
Macedonians. Whereas Lælius reproached Cicero in the senate for
sitting silent when Cæsar, a beardless youth, asked leave to come
forward, contrary to the law, as a candidate for the consulship; and
Brutus, in his epistles, charges him with nursing and rearing a greater
and more heavy tyranny than that they had removed.</p>

<p>Finally, Cicero’s death excites our pity; for an old man to be miserably
carried up and down by his servants, flying and hiding himself
from that death which was, in the course of nature, so near at
hand—and yet at last to be murdered. Demosthenes, though he
seemed at first a little to supplicate, yet, by his preparing and keeping
the poison by him, demands our admiration; and still more admirable
was his using it. When the temple of the god no longer
afforded him a sanctuary, he took refuge at a mightier altar, freeing
himself from arms and soldiers, and laughing to scorn the cruelty of
Antipater.”—<span class="smcap">Clough.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A moralist as well as a biographer, Plutarch wrote many
ethical and philosophical essays. The death of his daughter
called forth a feeling letter to his wife,—“the Consolation,”—in
which he affectionately bids her not give way to extravagant
grief, but submit with resignation to the blow, comforting
her with thoughts of immortality; it may be added that he
held Plato’s views on this subject as on others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>In his “Essay on Inquisitiveness” he condemns all eagerness
to learn news and impatience in opening letters, or
“biting the strings in two, as many will if they do not succeed
at once with their fingers.” As an example of dignified patience,
he instances Rusticus at Rome, who in the midst of
a lecture received a letter from the emperor Domitian, but
would not open it till Plutarch had finished speaking.</p>


<p><b>Lucian</b> (probably 120-200 A.D.); one of the wittiest of
Greek writers, was a native of Syria, and passed his boyhood
on the banks of the Euphrates. Doubtless his favorite
amusement of moulding wax into figures weighed with his
parents, no less than their own poverty, when they bound him
as an apprentice to his mother’s brother to learn the sculptor’s
art. The young Lucian enthusiastically fell in with
their decision, fondly anticipating the time when he should
astonish his playfellows with little gods cut from the marble
by his own hands. But his maiden attempt in the statuary’s
shop resulted in a broken slab and a cruel whipping at the
hands of his uncle. “The first wages I earned,” he said,
“were tears”—but they were also the last. He never returned
to the chisel and mallet.</p>

<p>After picking up a rhetorical education, by what means
he does not tell us, Lucian established himself at Antioch
as a lawyer; but failing of success, he set out on a lecture
tour through Europe. In Gaul, where rhetoric, the art
he taught, was in special demand, he accumulated a fortune;
with which he retired from his profession in the
prime of life, and took up his residence at Athens. Here
he prosecuted his literary studies, exchanged his Syrian
Greek for pure Attic, and is believed to have written his
finest Dialogues.</p>

<p>At the age of seventy, Lucian found himself so reduced as
to be obliged to accept from the Roman emperor the clerkship
of the Alexandrian courts. This position, which allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
him to continue his literary labors, he is said to have enjoyed
until his death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucian’s Style and Writings.</span>—Piquant humor, inimitable
power of satire, and wonderful versatility, are Lucian’s
strong points. His style is clear and graceful. Of his voluminous
writings the most popular are the “Dialogues”
on various subjects, serious and humorous. He attacked
falsehood and trickery, folly and superstition; and the deadly
blows he rained upon his country’s mythology, which led
to his being called “the Blasphemer,” indirectly, though unintentionally,
helped the spread of Christianity.</p>

<p>In the “Dialogues of the Gods,” the deities talk over the
domestic affairs of the Olympian household, gossip, and wrangle,
and pry into one another’s secrets, quite after the manner
of humans. Such a belittling of the national divinities could
not be without an unsettling effect on the popular faith.—The
“Dialogues of the Dead” are equally rich with humor
and ridicule.</p>

<p>Against the philosophers of his day, whom he looked upon
as miserable charlatans, Lucian launched the laughable Dialogue
entitled “the Sale of the Philosophers,” in which the
founders of the old schools are disposed of at auction by
Jupiter in a slave-market, Mercury playing the part of auctioneer.
Pythagoras is put up first and sells for $175; Diogenes,
the next, brings less than sixpence; while Socrates
commands the high price of two talents. Pyrrho, the universal
doubter, will not believe that he has been sold, even after
he has seen himself paid for and delivered. The laughing
Democritus and weeping Heraclitus fail to find a purchaser.
The attempted sale of these two philosophers is thus depicted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Jupiter.</span>—Bring out another. Stay—those two there, that fellow
from Abdera, who is always laughing, and the Ephesian, who is
always crying; I’ve a mind to sell them as a pair.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
<p><span class="smcap">Mercury.</span>—Stand out there in the ring, you two.—We offer you
here, sirs, two most admirable characters, the wisest we’ve had for

about something, for he’s in tears all the time. Holloa, you fellow!

and mock at all we say and do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Democritus.</span>—Undoubtedly; there’s nothing in life that’s serious.
Everything is unreal and empty—a mere fortuitous concurrence
of indefinite atoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Customer.</span>—You’re an indefinite atom yourself, you rascal! Confound
your insolence, won’t you stop laughing? But you there,
poor soul [<i>to Heraclitus</i>], why do you weep so? for there seems more
use in talking to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heraclitus.</span>—Because, stranger, everything in life seems to me to
call for pity and to deserve tears; there is nothing but what is liable
to calamity; wherefore I mourn for men and pity them. The evil
of to-day I regard not much: but I mourn for that which is to come
hereafter—the burning and destruction of all things. This I grieve
for, and that nothing is permanent, but all mingled, as it were, in
one bitter cup—pleasure that is no pleasure, knowledge that knows
nothing, greatness that is so little, all going round and round, and
taking their turn in this game of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Customer.</span>—What do you hold human life to be then?</p>

<p>“The Sale of the Philosophers” has a sequel in “the Re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>suscitated
Professors.” Permitted to return to earth for a
day to revenge themselves on Lucian, the Philosophers capture
him, and bring him to trial before the goddess of philosophy.
He clears himself by showing that he has not
attacked the venerable sages themselves, but only the impostors
who cheat the world under their great names. In
the beginning of the Dialogue, Lucian is thus assailed by
the belligerent Socrates and his <i>confrères</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Socrates.</span>—Pelt the wretch! pelt him with volleys of stones—throw
clods at him—oyster-shells! Beat the blasphemer with your
clubs—don’t let him escape! Hit him, Plato! and you, Chrysippus!
and you! Form a phalanx, and rush on him all together. As Homer
says—’Let wallet join with wallet, club with club!’ He is the common
enemy of us all, and there is no man among ye whom he has not
insulted. You, Diogenes, now use that staff of yours, if ever you did!
Don’t stop! let him have it, blasphemer that he is! What! tired
already, Epicurus and Aristippus? Aristotle, do run a little faster!
That’s good! we’ve caught the beast! We’ve got you, you rascal!
You shall soon find out whom you’ve been abusing! Now what shall
we do with him? Let us think of some multiform kind of death
that may suffice for all of us, for he deserves a separate death from
each.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosopher A.</span>—I vote that he be impaled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosopher B.</span>—Yes—but be well scourged first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosopher C.</span>—Let his eyes be gouged out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosopher D.</span>—Ay—but his tongue should be cut out first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Socrates.</span>—What think you, Empedocles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Empedocles.</span>—He should be thrown down the crater of some volcano,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and so learn not to revile his betters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plato.</span>—Nay—the best punishment for him will be that, like
Pentheus or Orpheus,</p>

<p>
‘Torn by the ragged rocks he meet his fate.’<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucian.</span>—Oh! no, no, pray! spare me, for the love of Heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Socrates.</span>—Sentence is passed: nothing can save you.”</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Collins.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Lucian is also famous in another line. His “True History,”
a burlesque on the Munchausen stories of the old poets
and historians, recounts the stirring adventures of a party of
voyagers who sail westward from the Pillars of Hercules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
(Strait of Gibraltar). It describes their visit to the moon,
their sojourn in a country where wine flowed in rivers, their
twenty months’ experience inside of a sea-monster that swallowed
their vessel, and their discovery of “the Island of the
Blest,” with its golden-paved city and vines loaded with
monthly fruitage. The lunarians happened to be engaged in
war with the people of the sun, at the time of Lucian’s arrival,
and he had the good fortune to witness a grand review of the
lunar army. There were cavalry mounted on lettuce-winged
birds, darters of millet-seed, garlic-fighters, wind-coursers,
and archers who rode elephantine fleas. Spiders as large
as islands hovered on their flanks. On the side of the sun
were mustered horse-ants that covered two acres, archers on
colossal gnats, slingers who discharged fetid radishes, and
dog-headed men astride of winged acorns.—Had novel-writing
been in vogue in Lucian’s time, he would no doubt have
excelled in that department of fiction.</p>


<p><b>Pausanias</b>, the Lydian geographer, was a contemporary of
Lucian’s. It has been said that “no writer of antiquity except
Herodotus has stored away so many valuable facts in
a small volume” as he in his “Itinerary of Greece.” Pausanias
made art items a special feature of his Itinerary.</p>

<p><b>Other Writers of the Second Century.</b>—In the second century,
<span class="smcap">Claudius Ptolemy</span>, the astronomer, put forth his theory
of the universe: that the earth is stationary and the centre of
eight huge, hollow, crystal spheres, placed one within another.
The moon he located in the nearest sphere, Mercury in the
next, Venus in the third, the Sun in the fourth, Mars in the
fifth, Jupiter in the sixth, and Saturn in the seventh. The
eighth sphere he appropriated to the stars, which, despite
their distance, were still visible through the transparent crystal.
All these heavenly bodies he believed to revolve in their
respective spheres around the earth. Ptolemy’s “Syntaxis,”
or “Construction,” embodying these views, was received as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
authority until Copernicus, fourteen hundred years later,
taught the true theory of the solar system.</p>

<p>In this century, also, <span class="smcap">Justin Martyr</span> wrote his “Apologies”
in defence of Christianity against paganism; and
<span class="smcap">Polycarp</span>, bishop of Smyrna, his “Epistle to the Philippians”—both
sealing their faith with their blood. From
<span class="smcap">Irenæus</span>, bishop of Lyons, we have inherited a valuable
legacy in his “Treatise against Heresies.”</p>


<p><b>Origen</b>, the gifted pupil of Cle’mens the Alexandrian, an
ardent Christian philosopher, flourished in the third century.
Among his writings, which, including his discourses, were
numbered by thousands, are “Commentaries on the Scriptures,”
in the preparation of which he was assisted by clerks
who wrote in short-hand from his dictation. Origen also replied
effectively to <span class="smcap">Celsus</span>, an Epicurean philosopher who
some years before had attacked Christianity in his “True
Story,” a powerful and much-read work of the time.</p>


<p><b>Neo-Platonism.</b>—The Academic philosophy, modified by
its later professors and wrapped in a veil of mysticism, gave
rise to the eclectic school of the Neo-Platonists, which was
popular among the learned till the time of Constantine. The
seeds of this philosophy were planted by Philo the Jew, mentioned
on page 104 as attempting to reconcile Plato’s doctrines
with the teachings of the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ammonius</span>, of Alexandria, was the real founder of Neo-Platonism,
which, as it left his hand, was a medley of Plato’s
and Aristotle’s tenets harmonized with the leading doctrines
of Christianity. Though Ammonius enjoined his disciples to
keep the mysteries of his philosophy to themselves, <span class="smcap">Ploti’nus</span>,
one of his distinguished pupils, unfolded them in his
writings and taught them publicly at Rome, where he went
to live 244 A.D.</p>

<p>After Plotinus, <span class="smcap">Porphyry</span> became a shining light of the
Neo-Platonists; but he was an outspoken opponent of Chris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>tianity,
maintaining that the world was without beginning, and
denying the divinity of our Saviour. His work “Against the
Christians” was afterward burned by order of the Roman emperor
Theodosius the Great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iamblichus</span>, a successor of Porphyry, went back to the
mystical speculations of Pythagoras, and, taking quite a different
view from the early Neo-Platonists, turned his philosophy
to the support of paganism. The emperor Julian
the Apostate was one of his converts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eusebius</span>, the learned ecclesiastical historian, bishop of
Cæsare’a in the fourth century, was among those who repelled
the assaults of Porphyry on the Christian faith. He
was a favorite of Constantine, whose life he wrote.</p>


<p><b>Longinus</b> (213-273 A.D.) was the greatest critic and most
learned philosopher of his age. He studied and taught at
Athens, and by reason of his extensive information was
styled “the Living Encyclopædia.” The most distinguished
of his pupils was Zenobia, queen of Palmyra, a woman of
refined tastes and unusual talent. By his advice, she revolted
from Rome; overpowered by the emperor Aurelian, 273
A.D., she sought to exculpate herself by throwing the blame
upon her counsellor, and Longinus was put to death.</p>

<p>Part of this author’s “Treatise on the Sublime” is all that
remains of his many works.</p>


<p><b>Athanasius.</b>—A century after Longinus, lived Athanasius,
one of the main pillars of the early Christian Church. His
life was spent in contentions with Arius and his followers,
who denied the equality of Christ with the Father; in controversy
with them, his vigorous pen was constantly employed.</p>


<p><b>St. Chrysostom</b> (<i>golden-mouthed</i>, so called from his eloquence—350-407)
was the most famous of the Greek fathers. He
was archbishop of Constantinople, and a voluminous writer
of homilies, epistles, and commentaries. His language is
elegant, and his fund of figures inexhaustible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>


<h4>LIGHT LITERATURE.</h4>


<p><b>Novel-Writers.</b>—The novel and romance are not unrepresented
in Greek literature. <span class="smcap">Heliodo’rus</span>, a Phœnician by
birth, who lived toward the close of the fourth century, obtained
a well-deserved reputation as the author of “Æthiopica,”
a touching, pure-toned, but somewhat sensational, romance.
Its heroine, Charicle’a, an Ethiopian princess, exposed
by her mother in infancy and brought up in ignorance
of her birth, with her lover Theagenes, falls into the hands
of pirates and undergoes a variety of adventures. The tale
ends happily, quite in the modern style.</p>

<p>Heliodorus, later in life, gave up novel-writing for a mitre,
being made bishop of Tricca in Thessaly.</p>

<p>Another Greek novelist, perhaps a contemporary of Heliodorus,
perhaps belonging to a later generation, was <span class="smcap">Longus</span>,
author of the “Loves of Daphnis and Chloë.” The scene of
this pastoral love-story is laid in the groves of Lesbos, where
the hero and heroine have grown up together in the bonds
of innocent affection, <i>à la</i> “Paul and Virginia.”</p>

<p>The “Story of Leucippe and Cli’tophon,” by <span class="smcap">Achilles
Ta’tius</span>, an Alexandrian rhetorician who flourished about
500, stands next to the “Æthiopica” among the Greek novels.</p>


<p><b>Hierocles.</b>—The “Facetiæ” of Hierocles (5th century)
must not be forgotten in this connection. Though a Neo-Platonist,
grave and learned enough to discuss “Providence
and Fate” and make a volume of profound commentaries on
the Golden Verses of Pythagoras, he evidently enjoyed a good
joke. He has left us twenty-eight brief stories of <i>Scholastici</i>,
or bookworms so unsophisticated and unused to the ways of
the world that we may call them simpletons. A few of these
are given as samples of his humor; from which it may be
seen that some of the wit that passes for modern is as old
as Hierocles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>


<p class="center">STORIES OF SIMPLETONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A simpleton, wishing to swim, was nearly drowned; whereupon
he swore that he would never touch the water until he had learned
how to swim.</p>

<p>A simpleton, visiting a sick person, inquired about his health.
He, however, was not able to reply. Thereupon the simpleton, being
angry and scolding the man, said: “I hope that I shall be sick some
of these days, and then when you come to ask how I am, I will not
answer.”</p>

<p>A simpleton, wishing to teach his horse to be a small eater, gave
him no food at all. At length the horse having starved to death, he
exclaimed: “I have suffered a great loss, for now that he had just
learned not to eat he has died.”</p>

<p>A simpleton, looking out of the window of a house which he had
bought, asked the passers-by whether the house was becoming to
him.</p>

<p>A simpleton, having dreamed that he had trodden on a nail and
that the wound pained him, on waking bound up his foot. Another
simpleton, having learned the cause, remarked: “It served you
right, for why do you sleep without sandals?”</p>

<p>A simpleton, meeting a doctor, hid himself behind a wall. Some
one asking the cause, he answered: “I have not been sick for a long
time, and therefore I am ashamed to come into the sight of a physician.”</p>

<p>A simpleton had sealed up a vessel of Aminæan wine which he
had. His servant, having made a hole in the vessel beneath and
drawn off some of the wine, he was astonished to see the contents
diminished while the seals remained unbroken. A neighbor having
told him to look whether it had not been taken out from below, he
replied: “Why, you fool, it’s the upper part, not the lower, that is
missing.”</p>

<p>A simpleton, meeting another simpleton, said, “I heard you were
dead.”—“And yet,” replied the other, “you see that I am still alive.”—“Well,”
said the first in perplexity, “I don’t know what to believe,
for he who told me is much more deserving of confidence than you.”</p>

<p>A simpleton, learning that the raven would live more than two
hundred years, bought one and brought it up, that he might test the
matter.</p>

<p>Of twin brothers, one died. A simpleton, thereupon, meeting the
survivor, asked, “Is it you that died, or your brother?”</p>

<p>A simpleton, in danger of being shipwrecked, called for his tablets
that he might make his will. Seeing, thereupon, his slaves lamenting
their lot, he said, “Do not grieve, for I am going to set you
free.”</p>

<p>A simpleton, wishing to cross a river, went on board the boat on
horseback. When some one asked the reason, he answered that he
wanted to get over in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>A simpleton and a bald man and a barber, travelling together,
agreed to keep watch in turn four hours each while the others slept.
The barber’s turn came first. He quietly shaved the head of the
sleeping simpleton, and when the time elapsed awoke him. The latter,
scratching his head as he got up, and finding it bare, cried out:
“What a rascal that barber is; he’s waked the bald man instead of
me!”</p>

<h4>BYZANTINE LITERATURE.</h4>

<p>The list of sophists, grammarians, historians, and other
writers belonging to the Byzantine period, contains names
without number and without lustre. A love-song of the Justinian
era (527-565 A.D.), by the emperor’s privy-councillor,
will give an idea of the poetry of this age.</p>

<h4>THE GREEK ANTHOLOGY.</h4>

<p><b>The Anthology</b> (<i>bunch of flowers</i>) is a collection of more
than four thousand short pithy poems, from the pens of about
three hundred Greek writers.</p>

<p>Melea’ger was the first gatherer of these literary flowers;
his “Garland” contained choice morsels of poetry from the
time of Sappho down, many of the best pieces being the work
of his own hand. “Meleager’s poetry,” says Symonds, “has
the sweetness of the rose, the full-throated melody of the
nightingale.” Others added to Meleager’s collection, the last
ancient anthologist being the historian Aga’thias, who flourished
at Constantinople in the reign of Justinian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>The pieces of the Greek Anthology are epigrams and fugitive
verses, amatory, witty, and didactic. Some of them compare
favorably with the best efforts of the writers already considered;
while not a few are plainly the sources of some of
the household sayings and proverbial philosophy of modern
times. (<i>Consult Macgregor’s “Greek Anthology.”</i>)</p>

<small><i>LATIN AND ITS OLDEST MONUMENTS.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Italy Peopled.</b>—While watching the rise, meridian splendors,
and glowing sunset of Grecian letters, we have left unnoticed
the dawn of literary taste in Italy, the sister of Hellas, peopled,
as we have seen, by kindred Phrygian tribes who spoke
dialects of the Phrygo-Hellenic tongue (p. 133). Whether
they were the first of human kind to wake the echoes of the
Italian solitudes, must ever remain a matter of doubt. Some
believe that the Alps had proved an insuperable barrier to previous
emigrants from the East; others, that the adventurous
Pelasgians, on descending their slopes, found a Turanian population
already in possession of the peninsula. If the latter
theory be correct, the Turanian aborigines were speedily overpowered
by the new-comers and became incorporated with
their conquerors.</p>

<p>When Rome was founded, 753 B.C., the predominant Italian
races were distinguished as Latin and Umbrian (embracing
the Oscans); their languages were closely related, and
have been called <i>Italic</i>. The Etruscans, who lived west of the
Tiber, though probably of Aryan origin, differed in many respects
from the Umbrians and Latins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

  <div class="caption">ANCIENT ITALY<br />
and the<br />
PLACES NOTED<br />
in the<br />
HISTORY of its LITERATURE</div>
</div>

<p>[See the above map for the various localities mentioned in connection with
Roman Literature.]</p>


<p><b>The Latin Language</b>, in its most ancient form, was probably
spoken by the people of Latium at least twelve hundred years
before the Christian Era. For many centuries it remained
harsh and unpolished, nor did its roughness materially wear
away until it came in contact with the Greek, about 250 B.C.
Then its vocabulary was enriched, and it gradually acquired
elegance and beauty. A knowledge of Greek came to be regarded
as indispensable to a polite education, and Roman
children were taught this language before their own.</p>

<p>A reaction, however, ultimately set in, and the foisting of
foreign words and idioms on the native tongue was con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>demned
as strongly as it had once been favored; a strange
expression was now compelled to run the gantlet of merciless
criticism before it was admitted as part of the language.
Cæsar advised to shun a new term as one would a reef;
Augustus frankly acknowledged that, though he was emperor
of the world, he could not make a Latin word; and Tiberius
was thus pointedly rebuked by a Roman grammarian for a
verbal error: “Thou, O Cæsar! canst confer Roman citizenship
on men, but not on words.”</p>

<p>When the rest of Italy submitted to the arms of Rome, it
accepted the language of the conqueror. Latin also supplanted
the Carthaginian tongue in Africa and Spain, Celtic
in Gaul and Britain, and finally was spoken in greater or
less purity throughout the empire.</p>

<p>In its perfection, which it attained during the first century
B.C., Latin was characterized by energy, dignity, and precision,
its power and gravity compensating for the lack of “Attic
grace.” According to its system of grammar, six cases
and two numbers were distinguished; nouns, pronouns, and
adjectives, were declined; and verbs were varied in form
through the tenses and moods of two voices. Thus the Latin
had one more case-form than the Greek, but lacked the dual
number and middle voice of Greek and Sanscrit.</p>

<p>The Latin alphabet, consisting originally of twenty-one letters,
was borrowed from the Greeks through a Dorian colony
at Cumæ. Its resemblance to the Greek may be seen by
turning to page 87. The character X. of the Roman system
of notation is ascribed to the Etruscans.</p>


<p><b>Ancient Latin Relics.</b>—During the five centuries that followed
the founding of Rome, the literary history of the city is
all but a blank. Curious specimens of its antique tongue are
preserved in fragments of laws and a few inscriptions; but
the songs of the first Latin bards are lost forever. The legends
of Romulus, the seizure of the Sabine women, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
stories of Lucretia and Virginia, of Coriolanus and Horatius,—these,
with many similar traditions, were doubtless the subjects
of irregular ballads and heroic poems.</p>

<p>The rough simple verse in which they appeared was called
<i>Saturnian</i>;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> it is supposed to have been adopted from the
Etruscan poets, and charmed the ears of the Romans until
they listened to the more tuneful measures of the Greeks.
The time-honored Saturnian verses were then thrust aside,
with the old lays that told the proud conquerors of Italy of
their humble origin and early struggles. This ballad-poetry
may never have been written; sung from generation to generation,
it was kept alive to grace in after-days the epic of
Ennius and the pages of the historian Livy.</p>

<p>The oldest existing Latin poetry is inscribed on a tablet
exhumed at Rome in 1778. It is a chant of the <i>Arval Brothers</i>,
an association of priests founded under the Roman kings,
and consists of an invocation to Mars, the god of war, to avert
pestilence. Almost as venerable is a fragment from a <i>Salian
Hymn</i>, sung by the Salian (<i>dancing</i>) priests in honor of
Ja’nus. (<i>See Prof. Allen’s “Remnants of Early Latin.”</i>)</p>

<p>Extracts from the Laws of the Twelve Tables (450 B.C.),
which were destroyed in the early wars, have been collected
from the works of later writers. The old Latin, however, is
very obscure; so much did the language afterward change
that in the golden age the Salian poems were enigmas to
the Romans themselves.</p>

<p>There are also traces of an ancient Umbrian literature,
which has perished.</p>

rude satiric verses, and, according to Niebuhr, epic poems surpassing the works
of later times “in power and brilliance of imagination.” No remnants of all this
literature.—In prose, a primitive oratory.</p>

<small><i>DAWN OF ROMAN LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p>As Italy received her first lessons in reading and writing
from the Greeks, in law-making from Solon, in art from
Phidias and Praxiteles, so in polite literature she drew her
inspiration from the same source. The early Roman writers
not only took their cue from Greek authors, but were in
some cases downright imitators and mere translators.</p>

<p>A Greek slave, Livius Andronicus, who may be called the
father of Roman classical literature, translating the Odyssey
into Saturnian verse, introduced his captors to the literary
treasures of his country. Enraptured Rome eagerly snatched
the crown of letters as it fell from the head of her elder sister,
and for a time the borrowed jewels sparkled on her brow.
But she paid dearly for her brilliant ornaments; for, with
Greek taste and culture, came also Greek effeminacy and vice.</p>

<p>The aim of the first Latin writers was to give their tongue
the same polish as the model from which they copied; but
an excess of foreign graces was repugnant to the genius of
their more stately language, and it was soon seen that the
refinement of the Greek would prove fatal to the vigor of
Latin. Accordingly the Roman orators set their faces
against any further “Grecizing,” and struggled as manfully
to preserve the purity of their vernacular as they did to maintain
the moral purity of the nation, fast drifting into the dangerous
quicksands of sloth and self-indulgence.</p>

<p>The sixth and seventh centuries of Rome, the period cov<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>ered
by the present chapter, saw the birth of the regular
drama and its decline; the earliest attempts at epic and satiric
poetry; and the rise of a vigorous prose. Livius Androni’cus
paraphrased Greek tragedies; Nævius and Ennius not only
contributed to dramatic literature, but called epic poetry into
being; Plautus and Terence set forth a feast of good things
in their comedies; Lucilius, the father of Roman satire, lashed
vice and corruption unsparingly in his hexameters; and Cato
laid the foundations of Latin prose.</p>

<h4>DRAMATIC POETRY.</h4>

<p><b>The Roman Drama.</b>—While in the later and more developed
stages of Roman literature the plastic influence of
Greece is everywhere perceptible, in the earlier days there
were original elements, devoid of polish indeed, but possessing
the rude vigor that distinguished the nation. There was
a sort of drama, for instance, native to Italy. It appeared in
its primitive guise in the Fescennine<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> dialogues—metrical
songs accompanied with rustic dances—which were long the
delight of the mirth-loving Italian country-folk. When, however,
the improvised jests and satires of these entertainments
opened the door to malicious personal abuse, it was found
necessary to prohibit libellous verses by law.</p>

<p>The merry songs called <i>Saturæ</i> (from the <i>satura lanx</i>, dish
of various fruits offered to the gods) were brought upon the
Roman stage in the fourth century B.C. A flute accompaniment
and Etruscan actors, who through ignorance of the
Roman language merely played the part of dancers and pantomimists,
rendered the Saturæ highly attractive. At a later
period, these medleys formed the afterpieces to regular
dramas.</p>

<p>From the Oscan town Atella in Campa’nia, the so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
<i>Atellane Fables</i> derived their name—pieces with simple plots,
that pictured ancient village-life in Italy, with its inevitable
characters of the chatterbox, the sharper, and the long-eared
glutton. It was no disgrace for young nobles, appropriately
masked, to improvise the dialogue of the Atellane Fable, or
sing the songs in Saturnian verse.</p>

<p>The regular Roman drama was a copy of the Greek, and
first saw the light at the grand celebration over the downfall
of Carthage, when (240 B.C.) a real tragedy and comedy were
represented. Their author was</p>


<p><b>Livius Andronicus</b> (about 285-204 B.C.), who fell into the
hands of the Romans when his native city, Tarentum in
southern Italy, submitted to their arms. Brought to their
capital as a slave, he succeeded in obtaining his liberty and
opened a school for his support. The wants of his pupils led
him to translate Homer’s Odyssey into Latin; he thus not
only provided the Roman schools with a text-book which
held its place for centuries, but inspired the people generally
with a strong desire to become acquainted with the Greek
masterpieces, and gave a spur to the development of a national
literature.</p>

<p>Andronicus was no less successful as a literary caterer,
when he put upon the Roman stage his Latin versions of
certain Greek plays; yet, though the public relished higher
and more dignified dramatic performances than the Fescennines
and Saturæ, they loved the latter too much to dispense
with them entirely. The vulgar off-hand humor of the
amateur actors in these performances was long exceedingly
popular.</p>

<p>Andronicus had a rough theatre assigned him on the Aventine
Mount. In accordance with the fashion of his day, he
played entire parts without assistance, until an injury to his
voice obliged him to delegate the recitative passages to a
boy, who sung them to the accompaniment of the flute, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
he made the appropriate gestures. Thus originated a custom
which thereafter prevailed at Rome,—that of having two
actors, one to declaim and the other to gesticulate.</p>

<p>Livius Andronicus kindled the first spark of literary ambition
in Rome, and paved the way for her future progress in
letters. He enjoyed the respect of his contemporaries, and
was honored by succeeding generations, though Cicero pronounced
his plays unworthy of a second reading. If we
except a few doubtful lines, posterity knows his dramas only
by their titles.</p>


<p><b>Cneius Nævius</b> (269-204 B.C.), a Campanian by birth, after
serving in the First Punic War, took up his residence at Rome
and there made dramatic literature his profession. His first
play was represented about 235 B.C.</p>

<p>The Greek dramatists furnished Nævius with the material
for his tragedies and comedies, in the latter of which—better
adapted to his genius, and therefore more original—he particularly
excelled. Closing his eyes to the danger of satirizing
the patrician houses, he fearlessly revived the personal
attack of Aristophanes in his ridicule of Scipio and the Metelli.
His lampoons directed against the latter cost him
dear. The verse of the poet,—“It is fate, not merit, that has
made the Metelli always consuls of Rome,”—stung them to
the quick, and they procured his imprisonment. Nævius
employed the time in writing comedies; and after his liberation,
nowise daunted by his previous bad fortune, he let fly
his shafts at the nobility as recklessly as ever. Rome could
no longer tolerate him, and sent him forth from her gates to
die in exile.</p>

<p>The fate of Nævius proved a warning to future comic poets.
None were ambitious to assume the role which he had
played; but, taking Menander for their model rather than
Aristophanes, they sought their subjects in the follies and
foibles of society at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>So far as we can judge from the scanty fragments that remain,
the style of Nævius, though unpolished (for he still
wrote in the old Saturnian verse), was nervous, bold, and
pointed. His works were for centuries the delight of the
Romans, who admired his independence; while succeeding
authors did not regard it unworthy of their genius to borrow
the spirited thoughts of Rome’s first native poet. His epitaph
read as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If gods might to a mortal pay the tribute of a tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Muses would shed one upon the poet Nævius’ bier;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For when he was transferred unto the regions of the tomb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The people soon forgot to speak the native tongue of Rome.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sellar thus puts in English the old Roman’s description of
a flirt, which survives from one of his comedies:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Like one playing at ball in a ring, she tosses about from one to
another, and is at home with all. To one she nods, to another
winks; she makes love to one, clings to another. Her hand is busy
here, her foot there. To one she gives a ring to look at, to another
blows a kiss; with one she sings, with another corresponds by
signs.”</p>
</div>

<p>The ablest work of Nævius is an epic poem, which will be
described hereafter.</p>


<p><b>Ennius</b>, partly Greek, partly Oscan by descent, was born in
Rudiæ in southern Italy, 239 B.C. After serving with honor
in the Roman army in Sardinia, he was induced to visit Rome
by Cato the Censor, who appears at one time to have been
his patron.</p>

<p>Filled with a desire to refine the taste of his countrymen,
Ennius drew upon Euripides for their benefit. The titles of
twenty-five of his tragedies survive; but the fragments that
are preserved of these, as well as of several comedies, show
them to be mere copies of Greek pieces. Though gifted with
poetical genius and possessed of remarkable learning, Ennius
found imitation easier than original composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>In the following fragment from one of his plays, Ennius denies
the providence of God:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yes! there are gods; but they no thought bestow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On human deeds, on mortal bliss or woe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Else would such ills our wretched race assail?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would the good suffer? Would the bad prevail?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not, however, as a dramatic poet that Ennius has won
distinction. His renown is based on his “Annals,” or “Metrical
Chronicles,” of all their poems the favorite with the Romans,
in whose minds they were associated with the heroic
achievements they commemorated. The “Annals” must be
reserved for the present, while we view the progress of comedy
in the works of Plautus and Terence.</p>


<p><b>Titus Maccius Plautus</b> (254-184 B.C.), a contemporary of
Ennius, was the first great comic poet of Rome. A boorish
country-boy, he left his home among the mountains of Umbria
to seek his fortune in the capital, and was at first quite
successful as a stage-carpenter and decorator. The sobriquet
<i>Plautus</i>, by which he is universally known, was significant
of his large flat feet; nor do his personal peculiarities
generally, judging from a self-painted portrait in one of his
comedies, appear to have been of a very prepossessing type:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A red-haired man, with round protuberant stomach,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Legs with stout calves, and of a swart complexion:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Large head, keen eyes, red face, and monstrous feet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Unthrifty as he was uncomely, Plautus before long found
himself reduced to the menial employment of grinding corn
for a baker, to keep body and soul together; but his hardships
were the making of the man. While thus engaged, during
his unoccupied hours he tried his hand at writing comedies.
He struck the right vein; play followed play in rapid
succession; the author rose in public estimation, and during
the rest of his life reigned without a peer on the comic stage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
Modern imitations of his comedies prove how lasting has
been their popularity.</p>

<p>The Greek poets inspired the pen of Plautus; but he
paints Roman manners, breathes Roman sentiments, and employs
the idiomatic conversational Latin of his time. The
tone of his dramas is far from elevating; his humor, though
bold and sprightly, is coarse; and his Greek pictures of imbecile
fathers, dissipated sons, intriguing slaves, jealous husbands,
hungry parasites, and disreputable female characters
(for all other female characters, except servants, were studiously
kept in the background), had their effect in undermining
the stern old Roman virtue. Yet the style of Plautus is flowing
and animated; his plays are full of bustle and fun; and
we can but admire his fertility of invention and wonderful
command of language. Some of his characters are not unworthy
of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Plautus prefaced most of his comedies with prologues,
which served the purpose of modern play-bills in that they
contained brief analyses of the pieces. Curious requests appear
in some of these: women are asked to refrain from disturbing
the house by gossiping, children are desired to keep
quiet, and mothers are besought not to bring infants to the
theatre.</p>

<p>Twenty comedies of Plautus are extant, of which the finest
is “the Captives.” Its plot is as follows:—</p>

<p>During a war between Elis and Ætolia, Hegio, a rich
Ætolian, buys at a sale of captives Philoc’rates and Tyndarus
his slave, hoping to possess himself of a prisoner of rank to
exchange for a son, who has fallen into the enemy’s hands.
To effect the negotiation, he proposes to send the slave to
Elis with a message to the father of Philocrates, who, he
learns, is a man of wealth and standing. The devoted Tyndarus,
however, seizes the opportunity to restore Philocrates
to liberty, allowing him to go on the journey and remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
in his stead, a change of apparel having been made, to impose
upon Hegio. The parting scene between the two, in the presence
of their master, is among the best passages of the play.
The disguised Philocrates, about to leave, has inquired what
message he shall carry to the captive’s father:—</p>

<p>Hegio is moved to tears, and exclaims:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hegio, however, soon discovers the trick, and condemns
Tyndarus to the quarries—a punishment whose horrors the
young man compares to “the torments of the damned.” He
is freed from bondage on the return of Philocrates with Hegio’s
son—to learn that he also is a son of Hegio, stolen by
a slave in his infancy and mourned as lost for twenty years.
It had been his good fortune to be bought by the father of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
Philocrates, and to grow up the companion of the young
noble.</p>

<p>After this happy dénouement, the play closes with an address
to the audience, valuable for the view it gives of the
characters in the popular comedy.</p>

<p>Among the best-known of our author’s comedies are “the
Twins” and “the Three Silver Pieces.” In the former a series
of laughable incidents grows out of the resemblance of
twin brothers, separated for many years and suddenly brought
together. To this play Shakespeare owed the plot of his
“Comedy of Errors.” The second derives its name from
three coins paid to a man to disguise himself as a foreigner,
and pretend to bring a dowry of a thousand gold pieces to the
heroine from her father, who is abroad at the time. The unexpected
arrival of the father changes the aspect of affairs;
but the marriage takes place, and everything ends happily.</p>

<p><b>Terence</b>, “the Prince of the Roman Drama,” flourished be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>tween
195 and 159 B.C. Of his life the accounts are scanty
and unsatisfactory. He appears to have been a Carthaginian
slave-boy, the property of a Roman senator, who treated him
with great kindness, gave him an education, and at last set
him free. The youth’s mind matured early; and when only
twenty-one he submitted his first comedy, “the Andrian Maid,”
to the ædiles, who superintended dramatic representations, for
their acceptance. Referred by them to Cæcilius, a comic poet
of distinction, he repaired to the house of the latter at supper-time,
and, humbly seated on a stool, began to read his play.
The first few verses revealed to Cæcilius the genius of the
young author; he beckoned Terence to a seat beside him,
heard him through, and accepted his comedy at once.</p>

<p>On the performance of “the Andrian Maid,” the reputation
of Terence was secured. His plays paid him handsomely,
and gave him the entrée to the highest literary circles. The
great men of Rome became his intimates; among others,
Scipio, the future destroyer of Carthage. They are thought
to have encouraged Terence with the view of elevating the
masses through his dramas, and are even suspected of having
lent him a helping hand in their composition.</p>

<p>After completing six comedies, Terence sailed for Greece,
to travel and study there. He is believed to have translated
over one hundred of Menander’s plays. None of these versions
survive, and they are supposed to have been lost, together
with the poet himself, on the return voyage.</p>

<p>Terence, Carthaginian though he was, is distinguished for
the exceptional purity of his Latin and the beauty of his style.
His taste was cultivated; his sentiments were pure; and his
plays put to shame many a licentious comedy of the English
stage. In lively humor and comic effect, however, he falls
short both of Plautus and his Greek originals. It was in allusion
to the source whence he borrowed his plots that Julius
Cæsar addressed him as “thou half-Menander.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>The masterpiece of Terence is “the Self-Tormentor,” a copy
of one of Menander’s lost plays. Its title is derived from the
self-inflicted punishment of Menede’mus, an Athenian, who,
having refused his consent to the nuptials of his son Clin’ia
with a poor but virtuous Corinthian girl, Antiph’ila, and thus
driven Clinia to enlist as a mercenary, is stricken with remorse,
leaves the city, and imposes on himself the severe toil
of farm-life.</p>

<p>Chremes, a neighboring country gentleman, noticing how
hard Menedemus works when there is apparently no necessity
for it, inquires the reason. The first scene represents a conversation
between the two, in which Menedemus, after asking
his neighbor how he found time to pry into other people’s
affairs, and receiving the memorable answer,—“I am a man,
and I have an interest in everything that concerns humanity,”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>—acquaints
him with the state of affairs as told above.</p>

<p>The love-sick Clinia now returns, and, reluctant to go to
his father’s house, becomes the guest of Chremes’ son, Clit’ipho,
the friend of his youth. At his entreaty, Clitipho sends
a slave for Antiphila; but the cunning fellow brings at the
same time the lady-love of Clitipho himself, the dashing beauty
Bacchis, introducing her to the family as Clinia’s mistress, and
passing off the modest Antiphila as one of her servants. The
slave thus describes to Clinia, Antiphila and her employments
when he came suddenly upon her, and announced her lover’s
return:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Busily plying the web we found her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Decently clad in mourning. She had on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No gold or trinkets, but was plain and neat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dressed like those who dress but for themselves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No female varnish to set off her beauty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her hair dishevelled, long, and flowing loose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">About her shoulders.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>
<p>Chremes finds Bacchis a very expensive guest, and, announcing
to Menedemus the next morning the return of his
son, tries to put him on his guard against the extravagant
tastes of Clinia’s supposed mistress, but without producing
any effect on the father thus relieved of his anxiety:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">He couldn’t stand it—how on earth can you?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">She’s very curious, mind you, as to her wines;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knows the best brands—and drinks them. ‘Ha!’ she’d say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘This wine’s not dry enough, old gentleman—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Get us some better, there’s a dear old soul!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I had to tap my oldest casks. My servants</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The play is full of amusing incidents,—the intrusions of the
eager Clitipho on the pretended love-making of his adored
Bacchis and Clinia—the indignation of Chremes at his son’s
seeming want of politeness—the cozening of Chremes by the
clever slave out of a large sum for his young master to give
to Bacchis. The discovery that Antiphila is Chremes’ own
daughter, whom, at her birth, his wife had given to a Corinthian
woman to expose, adds fresh interest to the plot. The
marriage takes place to the delight of all parties. Chremes is
persuaded to forgive his son, who promises to abandon Bacchis
for a more modest wife. The “Self-Tormentor” is happy
at last, and can afford to indulge in a hearty laugh at the misfortunes
of his neighbor.</p>

<p><b>Decline of the Drama.</b>—While the comedies of Terence
were drawing crowded houses, tragedy, which Ennius attempted
to popularize, that the heroic examples of early times might
be emulated by his countrymen, was successfully cultivated by
his nephew <span class="smcap">Pacuvius</span> “the Learned” (220-132 B.C.). The
thirteen tragedies of Pacuvius (an accomplished painter as
well as poet) were long favorites, particularly with the educated
classes. The finest of them, “Orestes in Slavery,” contained
the famous scene between the bosom friends Py’lades and
Orestes, in which each offers his life for the other. At its
representation, the audience leaped to their feet and shouted
their applause.</p>

<p>But Rome was no genial home for the tragic drama, and
both tragedy and comedy soon began to languish. With
Terence, the glory of the Roman theatre expired. Rope-dancing,
buffoonery, and the games of the circus, offered superior
attractions; and as the Republic lapsed into the Empire,
the degenerate taste of the people sought gratification in the
sports of the arena, where gladiators fought together or with
wild beasts hardly more of brutes than themselves. In this
first period of the national literature, the history of the Roman
drama is written. (<i>Read Mommsen’s “History of Rome.”</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>


<h4>EPIC POETRY.</h4>


<p><b>Nævius</b>, meanwhile, ventured to appeal to the popular taste
in a new department of poetry, with his epic, “the (First) Punic
War”—in which contest, it will be remembered, the poet took
an active part. It was written during his banishment at Utica,
after he had signalized himself as a dramatist at Rome,
and was a work which Cicero said “afforded him a pleasure
as exquisite as the finest statue ever chiselled by Myron.”</p>

<p>“The Punic War” entitles Nævius to the claim of originality
as well as genius. The episode of Dido and Æneas, the
career of Regulus, and other soul-stirring stories, were told
in its Saturnian lines; and it must ever be a matter of regret
that so interesting a poem is virtually lost to literature.
Nævius is called “the last of the native minstrels.”</p>


<p><b>Ennius</b> (239-169 B.C.).—In Ennius we are introduced to a
greater epic poet, and the founder of a new school. Brought
to Rome, as we have seen, by Cato, he taught the young nobles
Greek, translated dramas from that tongue, and devoted
his leisure to poetical composition. A panegyric on Scipio
decided his destiny; he rapidly rose in the estimation of the
distinguished men of the time, and in 184 B.C. was made a
Roman citizen—an honor to which Livius Andronicus had
never aspired, and which Nævius sought in vain.</p>

<p>Though a friend of the wealthy and powerful, Ennius himself
seems never to have been rich in this world’s goods. A
genial <i>bon vivant</i>, he spent his earnings in extravagant living;
and much of his poetry was written while he was confined by
the gout, a disease brought on by intemperate habits. Horace,
perhaps, exaggerates his failing when he tells us that
“Father Ennius never sung battles unless intoxicated.” The
family tomb of his friend Scipio became the final resting-place
of Ennius; and from his time the name of poet was honored
by the aristocracy of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>Ennius owes his fame chiefly to his “Annals,” an historical
epic, the work of his old age. Here he wove together the ancient
legends and folk-lore of the Romans handed down in
Saturnian ballads, with later accredited events, and contemporary
history, accomplishing the difficult task of adapting
the old Latin to dactylic hexameters. Greek metres henceforth
superseded the irregular Saturnian verse, the syllables
being arranged according to quantity, and not as before by
accent. Moreover, the language was indebted to him not
only for this improved versification, but for fresh elements of
strength, and grammatical changes for the better. Thus Ennius
introduced a new era in Roman literature, laying solid
foundations on which his successors built. He is recognized
as “the father of Latin song,” and it has been well said:
“Whatever in the later poets is most truly Roman in sentiment
and morality, appears to be conceived in the spirit of
Ennius.”</p>

<p>Ennius had a high opinion of his own talents; he deemed
himself the Roman Homer, and claimed, in accordance with
the Pythagorean doctrines, that the soul of the Greek bard
had passed into his frame from the intermediate body of a
peacock. And indeed his spirited battle-scenes, his “verses
fiery to the heart’s core,” sometimes recalled his sublime prototype;
while an air of antiquity breathed in his picturesque
style and archaic forms.</p>

<p>The poet’s self-praise was echoed by his countrymen. Cicero
proudly styled him “our own Ennius;” Virgil enriched
the Æneid with his most musical verses; Horace hailed him
as “the Calabrian Muse.” The triumphs of Rome and her
heroes were often told in the verse that he made familiar;
even during the Dark Ages his works remained favorites, until
in the thirteenth century they gradually sunk into obscurity.
(<i>Read Sellar’s “Roman Poets of the Republic.”</i>)</p>

<p>The versatile genius of Ennius displayed itself in satires,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
epigrams, and didactic poems, as well as in epics and dramas.
A curious specimen of his composition was his metrical treatise
on edible fish, a compilation from a number of existing
works on the subject.</p>

<p>From the fragments that remain of “the Annals” (600
lines in all) we present one of the most pleasing passages,—that
in which the vestal Il’ia tells her elder sister a dream
she has had, foreshadowing her great destiny as the mother
of Romulus, founder of Rome.</p>


<p class="center">ILIA’S DREAM.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quick rose the aged dame, with trembling limbs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The light to bring; and Ilia then, from sleep aroused,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With tears and terror tells her wondrous dream:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Child of Eurydice, by our sire beloved,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all my fibres fail my strength and life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A goodly man, methought, bore me away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through pleasant willow-groves and places strange.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next, all alone I seemed to wander desolate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And slowly, sister, to retrace my steps,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee seeking but not finding; nor did path</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steady my steps. Soon a familiar voice—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My father’s—thus with pitying accents spoke:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Daughter, ’tis thine deep sorrow to endure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This borne, thy great good fortune then is sure!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He spoke, and suddenly departing, gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To my fond yearning arms no sweet embrace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! I saw him not, though eagerly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the blue vault of heaven I stretched my hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And called on him with loving tones. At last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With aching heart sleep left me, and I woke.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The “Annals” were continued, and Homer’s Iliad was rendered
into Latin hexameters, by imitators of Ennius. But
they were third or fourth rate men, and epic poetry really
slumbered after Ennius passed from the stage, till it wakened
to new triumphs at the call of Virgil.</p>


<h4>SATIRIC POETRY.</h4>

<p>In this era, we have to chronicle the birth of a new plant in
the parterre of Roman literature—Satirical Poetry. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
no exotic, but native-born. The germ appeared in Nævius,
the bud in Ennius, the full-blown blossom in Lucilius, the
ripe fruit in the golden age of Augustus; the leaves were
still green in the declining days of the empire.</p>


<p><b>Lucilius</b> (148-103 B.C.), a Roman knight who fought under
Scipio at the siege of Numantia, converted the <i>miscellanies</i>
(<i>saturæ</i>) of Ennius into true satire. Though a mere youth,
he was intimate with Rome’s greatest statesmen, who were
accustomed to doff their dignity in his lively society, and even
to frolic with him before dinner. Shielded by them, and taking
as his standard the stern morality and lofty patriotism of
the fathers, he assailed with impunity prevalent social vices,
ridiculed superstition, and denounced political corruption.</p>

<p>In bold relief against this dark background he brought out
the noble qualities of Scipio. Always arrayed on the side of
virtue, he devoted his brilliant talents to the improvement of
the public morals. Yet he occasionally stooped to abuse, if
we may believe the story that, having once sued a person for
attacking his character, he lost his case because it was shown
that he himself was not above similar practices.</p>

<p>The satires of Lucilius were embraced in thirty books, many
fragments of which are extant. His style is forcible and not
without elegance, though some of his verses are harsh and occasional
Greek words lower the standard of his Latinity. He
composed with haste, often standing on one foot while he
dictated two hundred verses. His satires, had they been
preserved, would have been valuable as a mirror of Roman
manners.</p>


<p class="center">VIRTUE AS DEFINED BY LUCILIUS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Virtue, Albinus, consists in being able to give their true worth
to the things on which we are engaged, among which we live. The
virtue of a man is to understand the real meaning of each thing: to
understand what is right, useful, honorable, for him; what things
are good, what bad, what is unprofitable, base, dishonorable; to
know the due limit and measure in making money; to give its prop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>er
worth to wealth; to assign what is really due to honor; to be a
foe and enemy of bad men and bad principles; to stand by good
men and good principles; to extol the good, to wish them well, to
be their friend through life. Lastly, it is true worth to look on our
country’s weal as the chief good; next to that, the weal of our parents;
third and last, our own weal.”—<span class="smcap">Sellar.</span></p>
</div>


<h4>EARLY LATIN PROSE.</h4>

<p>In her prose, Rome owed but little to Greece. Had she
never known the Greek masters, she might not have produced
a poetical literature, but she would have had her great
orators and historians. Statesmanship was the natural profession
of her nobles and educated men; jurisprudence and
oratory were essential accomplishments of the aspirant to
public honors; and Latin was peculiarly adapted to prose
composition, which appears to have been practised very early
in Latium. The development of this primitive, yet nervous,
prose was not left to Greek slaves and freedmen, but called
forth the efforts of the foremost citizens,—Cato the Censor,
Lælius and Scipio, the Gracchus brothers, Crassus and Antonius,
Hortensius. In the period under consideration it
began to lose its ruggedness, and acquire polish, grace, and
harmony.</p>


<p><b>Cato</b> (234-149 B.C.).—The early historians of Rome, following
the example of <span class="smcap">Fabius Pictor</span>, the first of her prose
annalists, employed the Greek language. It was the elder
Cato, the Censor and moralist, the inflexible enemy of all that
was Greek, whose warning voice foretold the national corruption
that must follow the introduction of Hellenic literature;
it was Cato, the philosopher, orator, and historian, who dignified
Latin prose by embodying in it his vigorous thoughts.</p>

<p>Inured from boyhood to hard toil and simple fare on his
father’s Sabine farm, Cato took an active part in the war
against Hannibal, returning after the conflict to his humble
rustic life. But his country soon demanded his services in
another field; at her bar he won even greater glory, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
rewarded him with every office in her gift. Cato nobly discharged
his various trusts; but it is as the uncompromising
foe of effeminacy and vice that we know him best. His political
life, a model of economy and uprightness, was a ceaseless
battle with corruption—a struggle to banish the luxury he
despised and restore the stern virtue of his fathers. But it
was one man against a nation, and the current was too strong
for one alone to stem. He served Rome to the bitter end,
and fell in the traces at the age of ninety, his energies unimpaired,
his purpose unshaken.</p>

<p>Amid all his active duties, Cato, whose constitution like
his will was of iron, found time for literary work. He is
known to have written at least one hundred and fifty orations,
not without faults of style, for the amenities he was too apt to
disregard, but cogent in their reasoning, clear and powerful in
expression. Extensive remains of his practical hand-book
“on Agriculture” are extant, which show him to have been
familiar with all the details of the farm and garden. In a
work on medicine, dedicated to his son, he exclaims against
the Greek physicians, and recommends the simple remedies
which he had always found efficacious. His prejudice against
medical men was founded on the belief that their introduction
from Greece was a deep-laid plot to poison his fellow-citizens;
moreover, he knew that Rome had thriven marvellously
for five centuries, in blissful ignorance of the medical
faculty.</p>

<p>Cato’s chief work was his “Origines” (in seven books), a
history of his country, deriving its name from the first three
books, which discussed the origin of Rome and the Italian
states. The aged patriot prepared this treatise just before
his death, to throw it into the scale against Greek influence;
but not a hundred Catos could have turned the balance then.
The loss of the “Origines” is an irreparable one to archæology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>


<p class="center">SPECIMENS OF CATO’S STYLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For myself, I think well of a merchant as a man of energy and
studious of gain; but it is a career that leads to danger and ruin.
Farming, however, makes the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers;
and of all sources of gain is the surest, the most natural, and
the least invidious. Those who are busy with it have the fewest
bad thoughts.”—<span class="smcap">Treatise on Agriculture.</span></p>

<p>“Buy not what you want, but what you must have; what you
don’t want is dear at a farthing.”—“Men are worn out by hard
work; but if they do no work, rest and sloth injure them more than
exercise.”</p>


<p class="center">HEROISM OF CÆDICIUS.</p>

<p>During the First Punic War the Roman army was surprised and
threatened with destruction, when Cædicius the Tribune promptly
volunteered to engage the enemy with 400 men, while the rest escaped.
The little band was cut down to a man.</p>

<p>“The immortal gods,” said Cato, “granted the tribune a lot according
to his valor. For thus it came to pass. Though he had received
many wounds, none proved mortal; and when his comrades
recognized him among the dead, faint from loss of blood, they took
him up and he recovered. But it makes a vast difference in what
country a generous action is performed. Leonidas of Lacedæmon,
who performed a similar exploit at Thermopylæ, is praised. On account
of his valor, united Greece testified her gratitude in every possible
way, and adorned his exploit with monumental records, pictures,
statues, eulogies, histories. The Roman tribune gained but
faint praise, and yet he had done the same and saved the republic.”—<span class="smcap">Origines.</span></p>
</div>


<p><b>Lælius</b> and <b>Scipio</b> followed Cato, and improved upon his
rude eloquence. Their speeches, which were committed to
writing, bore the impress of learning and genius.</p>


<p><b>The Gracchi</b> (169-121 B.C.), sons of the noble Cornelia,
Scipio’s daughter, to whom they owed their early education,
introduced a new era in Roman eloquence, and have been
called “the founders of classical Latin.” Both gave up their
lives in the interest of the Commons.</p>

<p>Tiberius, the elder, was the impersonation of clear-headed,
dispassionate, argumentative oratory. Caius, the younger, of
greater intellectual power, declaimed with such impetuosity
that it was his custom to keep a slave at his side to remind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
him with the note of a flute when his vehemence became immoderate.
Cicero inclined to the belief that, had not Caius
Gracchus met an untimely death, he would have been the
most brilliant representative of Roman eloquence. Nothing
remains of the speeches of Tiberius, and the few fragments
we possess of Caius indicate a want of finish.</p>


<p><b>Antonius</b> and <b>Crassus</b> were the most distinguished speakers
of the period that separated the Gracchi from Cicero.
Both were diligent students of Greek literature, though both
sought to conceal their indebtedness to it. Crassus excelled
in the elegance of his language; Antonius, in gesture.</p>


<p><b>Hortensius</b> (114-50 B.C.).—Crassus, in the last year of his
life, highly complimented the young Hortensius, whose promise
as an orator he was quick to discern. After the death
of Antonius (87 B.C.), Hortensius became “prince of the
Roman bar,” a position which he enjoyed until eclipsed by
the superior genius of Cicero (70 B.C.). During his early
manhood he labored with untiring industry, turning his remarkable
memory to good account. His style was ornate,
his voice perfect; his gestures were so graceful that actors
came to learn their art from him; never before had Rome
listened to a flow of language so copious and elegant. As a
matter of course his services were in great demand, and
hardly a day passed in which he did not either speak or
prepare a speech.</p>

<p>Thus Hortensius accumulated a vast fortune, which proved
his stumbling-block. Wealth begot a love of luxury, his energy
gave way to indolence, and he quietly yielded the first
place to his youthful rival. His luxurious villas, with their
deer-parks, and gardens whose plants he watered with wine,
were more to Hortensius than the victories of the forum. In
these charming retreats he loved to entertain his friends, and
exhibit to them his menagerie and tame fish—for which he
showed more concern than for his servants. The death of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
favorite lamprey affected him to tears. At his luxurious mansion
in Rome, the nucleus of the future imperial palace, peacocks
were served for the first time at a feast.</p>

<p>The orator’s tastes, however, were æsthetic as well; he
wrote poetry, and expended large sums on statues and paintings.
His orations are lost. Only the merest fragments of
all the above prose writers survive.</p>

<small><i>GOLDEN AGE OF ROMAN LITERATURE.</i></small></h3></div>

<p class="center"><small>(B.C. 80-14 A.D.)</small></p>


<p><b>Divisions and Ornaments.</b>—The Golden Age, which now
engages our attention, is naturally divided into two distinct
periods, bearing the names of Cicero, the greatest of Roman
writers, and Augustus, the founder of the empire and
patron of letters.</p>

<p>In the Ciceronian Period (80-43 B.C.), a stormy era of
conspiracy as well as conquest—marked by Catiline’s formidable
attempt to destroy the commonwealth, by the civil war
of Cæsar and Pompey, and the murder of these renowned
leaders—political eloquence and history monopolized the attention
of the master minds of Rome. As a consequence,
Latin prose matured early in the golden age; while poetry
boasted of no ornaments until, at the close of the Ciceronian
Period, Lucretius penned his philosophical poem “On
the Nature of Things,” and Catullus produced his erotic odes
and elegies.</p>

<p>In the Augustan Period (B.C. 42-14 A.D.), the greatest
of Roman poets, Virgil and Horace, lived and wrote, prose
playing a secondary part. Tibullus and Propertius put forth
their sweet elegies, and Ovid his amatory pieces. Even the
pages of Livy’s history are aglow with poetical coloring. But
the blossom was as transient as it was beautiful, and expanded
only to die.</p>

<h4>PROSE WRITERS OF THE CICERONIAN PERIOD.</h4>


<p><b>Marcus Tullius Cicero</b> (106-43 B.C.) was born at Arpi’num,
a Latian town south-east of Rome. As his family (of
equestrian rank) had never distinguished itself, he is known
as a <i>novus homo</i> (<i>new man</i>). Detecting unusual talent in the
boy, his father resolved to develop it by a thorough education,
which he himself superintended at Rome. The most accomplished
teachers were secured, the Greek poet Ar’chias
among the number, and the youth was thoroughly grounded
in grammar, rhetoric, and Grecian literature. This early
training Cicero sedulously supplemented with a course on
Roman law under Scævola, avoiding the whirl of dissipation
that surrounded him, and even relinquishing social pleasure
for the labors of his closet or to study in the forum the style
of the first public speakers. “Who can blame me,” he asked
in his oration for Archias, “if while others are gazing at festal
shows and idle ceremonies, exploring new pleasures, engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
in midnight revels, in the distraction of gaming, the madness
of intemperance, I dedicate <i>my</i> time to learning and the
Muses?”</p>

<p>At twenty-five Cicero made his début; and within two
years he rose to the highest rank at the Roman bar by ably
pleading the cause of one Roscius against a friend of the
terrible Sulla. Successful in this case, to escape the vengeance
of the dictator as well as to recruit his failing health,
Cicero went abroad. At Athens he pursued the study of
philosophy with Pompo’nius Atticus, the companion of his
boyhood and ever after his warmest friend. In the schools
of Asia Minor, as well as at Rhodes, then a great literary
centre, he studied under distinguished teachers, storing his
memory with valuable knowledge at the same time that he
made himself proficient in the rhetorical art. The death of
Sulla having removed all danger, at the age of thirty he went
back to Italy, thoroughly restored by his travels, and fired
with the noble ambition of making himself the Demosthenes
of Rome. Step by step he approached the realization of his
hopes, and when, in the prosecution of Verres, the rapacious
governor of Sicily, he triumphed over Hortensius (70 B.C.),
his end was practically achieved.</p>

<p>Cicero served his country in many capacities, but in none
more effectively than as consul; since, while holding this
office (63-62 B.C.), he saved the republic from a dangerous
conspiracy, headed by the profligate Catiline. The consul’s
tact and courage were sorely tried, but prevailed. Four
crushing orations laid bare the plans of the traitor and drove
him from the city, to fall in a desperate battle with the Roman
legions, while a grateful nation greeted the vigilant Cicero
as “the Father of his Country.”</p>

<p>But the Roman people were fickle, and at the instigation
of an enemy banished Cicero from the city he had saved,
58 B.C. The next year, however, the decree was revoked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
and he returned. When the civil war between Cæsar and
Pompey was imminent, Cicero’s indecision told powerfully
against him.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> At last he joined Pompey, who, provoked at
his vacillation, exclaimed: “I wish that Cicero would go over
to the other side; perhaps he would then be afraid of us.”
The battle of Pharsalia (48 B.C.) overthrew the hopes of the
party whose cause he had espoused, and Cicero, returning to
Italy, accepted the rule and friendship of Cæsar, and settled
down to a literary life.</p>

<p>Shortly after, a plot is laid against the dictator; the fatal
Ides (15th) of March (44 B.C.) arrive; the assassins do their
bloody work in the senate-house; and Brutus, flourishing his
traitorous dagger, cries to Cicero: “Rejoice, O Father of our
Country, for Rome is free!”</p>

<p>But it was grief, not joy, that the dagger of Brutus brought
to the Republic; another Pompey and another Cæsar arose
to contend for the mastery of the world. Marc Antony aspired
to the dead dictator’s place; but Cicero, now the foremost
statesman in Rome, regarding him as the enemy of liberty,
upheld the cause of the people and of Octavius, Cæsar’s
young nephew. Into the struggle that ensued, he entered
with all the spirit of his youth, thundering against Antony his
grand “Philippics,” in the second of which are concentrated
all his powers of invective, passion, and eloquence. It is
Cicero’s mightiest effort.</p>


<p class="center">FROM THE SECOND PHILIPPIC.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When, therefore, this fellow (<i>Antony</i>) had begun to wallow in the
treasures of that great man, he began to exult like a buffoon in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
play, who has lately been a beggar and has become suddenly rich.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
But, as some poet or other says,</p>

<p>
‘Ill-gotten gains come quickly to an end.’<br />
</p>

<p>It is an incredible thing, and almost a miracle, how he in a few, not
months, but days, squandered all that vast wealth. There was an
immense quantity of wine, an excessive abundance of very valuable
plate, much precious apparel, great quantities of splendid furniture,
and other magnificent things in many places, such as one was likely
to see belonging to a man who was not indeed luxurious, but who
was very wealthy. Of all this in a few days there was nothing left.
What Charybdis was ever so voracious? Charybdis, do I say? Charybdis,
if she existed at all, was only one animal. The ocean, I swear
most solemnly, appears hardly capable of having swallowed up such
numbers of things so widely scattered, and distributed in such different
places, with such rapidity.</p>

<p>Nothing was shut up, nothing sealed up, no list was made of anything.
Whole storehouses were abandoned to the most worthless of
men. Actors seized on this, actresses on that; the house was crowded
with gamblers, and full of drunken men; people were drinking
all day, and that too in many places; there were added to all this
expense (for this fellow was not invariably fortunate) heavy gambling
losses. You might see, in the cellars of the slaves, couches covered
with the most richly embroidered counterpanes of Cneius Pompey.
Wonder not, then, that all these things were so soon consumed.
Such profligacy as that could have devoured, not only the patrimony
of one individual, however ample it might have been, but whole cities
and kingdoms.</p>

<p>And then his houses and gardens! O the cruel audacity! Did
you dare to enter into that house? Did you dare to cross that most
sacred threshold? and to show your most profligate countenance to
the household gods who protect that abode? A house which for a
long time no one could behold, no one could pass by, without tears!
Are you not ashamed to dwell so long in that house—one in which,
stupid and ignorant as you are, still you can see nothing which is not
painful to you?</p>

<p>When you behold those beaks of ships in the vestibule, and those
warlike trophies, do you fancy that you are entering into a house
which belongs to you? It is impossible. Although you are devoid
of all sense and all feeling, still you are acquainted with yourself,
and with your trophies, and with your friends. Nor do I believe
that you, either waking or sleeping, can ever act with quiet sense.</p>

<p>It is impossible but that, were you ever so drunk and frantic, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
truth you are, when the recollection of the appearance of that illustrious
man comes across you, you should be roused from sleep by your
fears, and often stirred up to madness if awake. I pity even the walls
and the roof.”—<span class="smcap">Yonge.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The patriot paid for his stanch defence of freedom with his
life. Octavius and Antony, becoming reconciled, formed with
Lepidus the Second Triumvirate, or board of three, to govern
the Roman world; and Cicero knew that the sun of liberty
had set. The triumvirs agreed upon a general proscription
of their enemies. A reign of terror deluged Italy with blood,
but the noblest of those who fell was Cicero.</p>

<p>Antony demanded his life, and Octavius covered himself
with infamy by yielding it. The orator met his fate near his
villa at Formiæ; timid throughout his life, in the last scene he
exhibited manly fortitude. He is said to have been calmly
reading the “Medea” of Euripides in his litter when Antony’s
myrmidons overtook him; a desperado who owed him many
favors, while even his brutal companions covered their eyes,
struck the fatal blow. The head and hands of the murdered
orator were cut off and sent to Antony, whose inhuman wife,
as she fondled the ghastly head in her lap, maliciously thrust
her bodkin into the tongue that had denounced her husband.—True
as it was, it ill became the time-serving Octavius to
say, when afterward wielding the sceptre of the world as Augustus
Cæsar, “Cicero was a good citizen, who really loved
his country.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicero’s Works.</span>—Cicero was emphatically a many-sided
man, and filled a wide space in Roman literature. Though
he excelled chiefly in oratory, he has left us, besides fifty-nine
orations, a number of philosophical treatises, essays, and many
letters to his friend Atticus, his brother, and other correspondents.
While deeply absorbed in public duties, he found opportunities,
without neglecting these, to pursue the study of
philosophy, having in view not only his own relaxation, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
also the moral advancement of his countrymen. His works
on this subject, some of which, for the sake of interest and
variety, he wrote in the form of dialogues, present a valuable
survey of the Greek systems. They assert his belief in the
existence of one Supreme Creator and the immortality of the
soul. (<i>See Mayor’s “A Sketch of Ancient Philosophy.”</i>)</p>

<p>Cicero’s chief philosophical writings are “the Tusculan
Disputations,” imaginary discussions of various practical questions
at the author’s Tusculan villa,—the scorn of death, the
endurance of suffering, etc.; “the Offices,” a moral essay;
treatises “On Friendship” and “On Old Age,” justly considered
as among the most charming productions of their class
in any literature; political dissertations “On the Republic”
and “On Laws;” and a theological disquisition “On the Nature
of the Gods.”</p>


<p class="center">THE END OF LIFE.<br />

<small>[From Cicero’s Treatise on Old Age.]</small></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An old man, indeed, has nothing to hope for; yet he is in so much
the happier state than a young one; since he has already attained
what the other is only hoping for. The one is wishing to live long,
the other has lived long. And yet, good gods! what is there in man’s
life that can be called long? To my mind, nothing whatever seems
of long duration, in which there is any end. For when that arrives,
then the time which is past has flowed away; that only remains
which you have secured by virtue and right conduct. Hours indeed
depart from us, and days, and months, and years; nor does past time
ever return, nor can it be discovered what is to follow.</p>

<p>Whatever time is assigned to each to live, with that he ought to be
content: for neither need the drama be performed entire by the actor,
in order to give satisfaction, provided he be approved in whatever
act he may be; nor need the wise man live till the <i>plaudite</i>.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The
short period of life is long enough for living well and honorably; and
if you should advance farther, you need no more grieve than farmers
do, when the loveliness of spring-time hath passed, that summer and
autumn have come. For spring represents the time of youth, and
gives promise of the future fruits; the remaining seasons are intended
for plucking and gathering those fruits. Now the harvest of old
age, as I have often said, is the recollection and abundance of blessings
previously secured.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
<p>In truth, everything that happens agreeably to nature is to be
reckoned among blessings. What, however, is so agreeable to nature
as for an old man to die? which even is the lot of the young, though
nature opposes and resists. And thus it is that young men seem to
me to die, just as when the violence of flame is extinguished by a
flood of water; whereas old men die, as the exhausted fire goes out,
spontaneously, without the exertion of any force. And as fruits
when they are green are plucked by force from the trees, but when
ripe and mellow drop off, so violence takes away their lives from
youths, maturity from old men; a state which to me indeed is so delightful
that, the nearer I approach to death, I seem as it were to be
getting sight of land, and at length, after a long voyage, to be just
coming into harbor.”—<span class="smcap">Edmonds.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Cicero also wrote a treatise “On Glory,” now lost. It was
once in the possession of Petrarch, who commends it in the
most flattering terms. The Italian poet was induced to lend
it to his aged preceptor; but the latter, driven by poverty, secretly
put the work in pawn and died without making known
its whereabouts. It never saw the light afterward; although
it is supposed to have been destroyed two centuries later by a
plagiarist, who had helped himself to some of its fine periods.</p>

<p>As a letter-writer, Cicero excels all others. It was the custom
of his countrymen to bestow as great pains on private
correspondence as on works intended for publication; and his
epistles, eight hundred of which survive, are simple, elegant,
and glow with wit, though some of them were written so fast
as to be almost illegible. (<i>Consult Jeans’s “Life and Letters
of Cicero; Church’s “Roman Life in the Days of Cicero.”</i>)</p>

<p>Our author also turned his hand to history and poetry, but
with indifferent success. His works were extremely popular
among his contemporaries, some of them selling by the thousand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicero’s Style.</span>—Cicero has always been commended for
the cadence of his periods. The art of framing harmonious
balanced sentences was his special study, and the Latin language,
which he perfected in beauty and richness, was well
adapted to his purpose. His style is often exuberant, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
cultivated the flowers of rhetoric. Character he sketched
with a powerful pen, and his speeches are enlivened with
abundant illustrations drawn from the wonderful storehouse
of his memory. Too often, however, vanity crops out, to mar
the effect.</p>

<p>Quintilian declared that as an orator Cicero combined “the
force of Demosthenes, the copiousness of Plato, and the elegance
of Isocrates.” Through all his works flows a current
of mingled majesty and sweetness. Merivale aptly styles him
“the most consummate specimen of the Roman character under
the influence of Hellenic culture.”</p>


<p class="center">CICERO ON PROVIDENCE.<br />

<small>[From the Treatise on the Nature of the Gods.]</small></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are and have been philosophers who have given it as their
opinion that the gods exercise no superintending care whatever over
human affairs. Now, if the opinion of these men be true, what becomes
of piety? what of public worship? what of religion itself?
For all these marks of homage are to be rendered in a pure and holy
spirit unto the majesty of the gods, only in case they are observed by
these same, and in case any favor has been bestowed by the immortal
gods on the race of men. If, however, the gods are neither able nor
willing to assist us; if they take no care whatever of us; if they
mark not what we do; if there is nothing that can come from them
and exercise an influence on the lives of men,—what reason is there
why we are to pay any adoration, render any honors, offer any prayers,
to the immortal gods?</p>

<p>Piety, just as much as the other virtues, cannot exist in outward
show and empty feignings; while along with piety, both public
worship and religion itself must of necessity be done away with.
Remove these, and a great disturbance and total confusion of life
ensue. Nay, indeed, I do not know whether, if piety toward the
gods be removed, good faith also, and every social tie that binds together
the human race, and justice too, that most excellent of all
virtues, would not be removed along with it.”—<span class="smcap">Charles Anthon.</span></p>

<p><b>Varro</b> (116-28 B.C.).—The great central sun of the Republican
Era was Cicero, compared with whom the brightest of
his contemporaries seem but as lesser luminaries whose light
is swallowed up in his. Of these, Marcus Terentius Varro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
was perhaps the greatest. Years of incessant application,
which a boyhood passed among the Sabine mountains at
Reate (<i>re’ă-te</i>) had prepared him to endure, won for Varro
the proud title “Most Learned of the Romans.”</p>

<p>During the civil war, Varro sided with Pompey. After the
triumph of Cæsar, he retired from public life to his favorite
studies, the victor magnanimously recognizing his merit by
placing him in charge of the public library at Rome. The
material results of his literary labors enabled him to live like
a prince, and we find him the proprietor of three sumptuous
country-seats, one of which was celebrated for its costly marble
aviary of three thousand song-birds—Varro’s pets.</p>

<p>All this wealth did not escape the notice of the rapacious
triumvirs after the assassination of Cæsar. The name of
Varro, then more than seventy, was placed on the proscription
list; his property was confiscated; and Antony sacked
his beautiful villa at Casi’num, committing his invaluable library
to the flames. The old man owed his life to friends,
who concealed him from his implacable foe till the order for
his murder was countermanded. Augustus afterward restored
his fortune, but Varro always keenly missed the society
of his books. At the advanced age of eighty, he composed,
in dialogue form, an admirable work “On Husbandry,”
written in a brisk and entertaining style.</p>

<p>The genius of Varro was remarkably versatile; as over six
hundred different books on various subjects, in both prose
and verse, abundantly testify. In fertility he surpassed all
other Romans; and we can but wonder, with St. Augustine,
how he found time to write so much. His most creditable
work was his “Antiquities Divine and Human,” a lost treasure,
of which the present age, with its profound interest in the
religions of the past, severely feels the want.</p>

<p>Varro also prepared a treatise “On the Latin Language,”
edited a popular encyclopædia of the liberal arts, and wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
on history. Throughout his works he appears as a pure patriot,
a defender of ancient simplicity and virtue. His satires
on effeminacy and affectation are caustic; no one can help
enjoying his humorous etchings of the spruce dandy, the
dainty epicure, and the finical poet who gargles his throat
before reciting his pieces. In every kind of writing that
he attempted (and there was little he did not attempt) he
is worthy of respect: the familiar line from Dr. Johnson’s
epitaph on our own Goldsmith, would apply with equal force
to Varro—“He touched nothing that he did not adorn.”</p>

<p>Little survives of Varro’s writings beyond the treatise on
agriculture, and a part of that on the Latin language.</p>


<p><b>Julius Cæsar.</b>—July 12th, 100 B.C., was the birthday of
Caius Julius Cæsar, by some believed to be, as Shakespeare
styled him, “the foremost man of all this world.” The period
at which he lived was a critical one in history. Roman
virtue had depreciated, justice was bought and sold, luxury
had sapped the vigor of the nation, and vice ran riot. Only
one-man power, and that wielded by a clear head and powerful
arm, could save the state. The times demanded a statesman
who would not shrink from taking upon himself all needful
responsibilities; and in Julius Cæsar that statesman was
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Cæsar’s whole career evinces ambition, courage, and determination.
Sulla himself he feared not to defy, when ordered
to divorce his wife for political reasons; and he was adroit
enough to escape the vengeance of the ruthless dictator who
saw in “the loose-girt boy” many Mariuses. Leaving Rome
for the East, he acquitted himself with signal ability, though
only twenty-two, in a campaign against Mytilene; and when
captured by pirates on the high seas, he paid them an extortionate
ransom, but promptly turned the tables on them by
overhauling their vessel with a small fleet, and nailing them
to crosses on the coast of Asia Minor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>At Rhodes he studied oratory and rhetoric. On his return
to Rome he gave evidence of his powers in the forum, and
was hailed as second in eloquence to Cicero only. His readiness
to protect the poor and the oppressed, together with his
insinuating manners, made Cæsar the idol of the people, who
bestowed upon him various offices and finally raised him to
the consulship. At the expiration of his term, he was intrusted
with the government of the two Gauls; and the military
skill he displayed in this position, during nine years of active
service (58-50 B.C.), proved him to be one of the world’s
great captains. Overpowering many fierce tribes, he carried
the terror of the Roman eagles into the forests of Germany
and even across the Channel. A million human beings are
computed to have been sacrificed in his Gallic campaigns.</p>

<p>Jealous of these brilliant successes, and recognizing in
Cæsar a dangerous opponent of his schemes for political aggrandizement,
Pompey prevailed on the senate to demand the
resignation of his victorious rival. This brought matters to a
crisis. Cæsar with his legions crossed the Rubicon, which
separated Cisalpine Gaul from Italy (49 B.C.), and was soon
in Rome, whence Pompey and his friends had fled. The battle
of Pharsalia the next year decided the question in favor of
Cæsar; Pompey’s party was overthrown in Africa and Spain,
and the Roman world remained the prize of the conqueror.</p>

<p>Not long, however, did he enjoy it. Fearing his ambition,
or pretending to do so, a number of “liberators” conspired
against his life. On the 15th of March, 44 B.C., he fell pierced
by their daggers at the foot of Pompey’s statue, as that last
cry, wrung from his heart by the ingratitude of a trusted
friend, resounded through the senate-house,—“Thou, too,
Brutus, my son!”</p>

<p>We can hardly see how, amid the excitements of such a
career, Cæsar found any time to devote to literary pursuits;
yet his name is hardly less eminent in letters than for states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>manship
and military genius. He seems to have had the
rare ability of “employing at the same time his ears to listen,
his eyes to read, his hand to write, and his voice to dictate.”
While crossing the Alps, on one occasion, he wrote a grammatical
treatise of no little merit.</p>

<p>The greatest of Cæsar’s works are his “Commentaries” on
the Gallic and the Civil War—the former in seven books,
to which an eighth was added at the author’s request by
his fellow-soldier <span class="smcap">Hirtius</span>. In “the Gallic War,” Cæsar not
only recounts his successes and feats of engineering skill, but
also entertains us with pleasing descriptions of the countries
he visited and the tribes he encountered. He always aims
at justifying himself, and so plausibly defended his course
in “the Civil War” as to carry conviction even to the prejudiced.
(<i>See Froude’s “Cæsar;” Trollope’s “Cæsar.”</i>)</p>

<p>In Cæsar’s style, conciseness goes hand in hand with simplicity
and perspicuity. Dispensing with ornament, he uses
every word to the best advantage—and this despite the fact
that he wrote with amazing rapidity. Though, perhaps, he
lacks vivacity and energy, there is no purer Latin than his.
We subjoin some interesting paragraphs from the Commentaries
on the Gallic War, relating to the customs of</p>


<p class="center">THE ANCIENT GAULS AND GERMANS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The whole nation of Gauls is extremely addicted to superstition;
whence, in threatening distempers and the imminent dangers
of war, they make no scruple to sacrifice men, or engage themselves
by vow to such sacrifices. In these they make use of the ministry of
the Druids: for it is a prevalent opinion among them that nothing
but the life of man can atone for the life of man, insomuch that they
have established even public sacrifices of this kind. Some prepare
huge colossuses of osier twigs, into which they put men alive, and
setting fire to them, those within expire amid the flames. They
prefer for victims such as have been convicted of theft, robbery, or
other crimes, believing them the most acceptable to the gods; but,
when criminals are wanting, the innocent are often made to suffer.</p>

<p>Mercury is the chief deity with them; of him they have many images,
account him the inventor of all arts, their guide and conductor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
in their journeys, and the patron of merchandise and gain. Next to
him are Apollo and Mars, Jupiter and Minerva. Their notions in
regard to these are pretty much the same as those of other nations.
Apollo is their god of physic, Minerva of works and manufactures;
Jove holds the empire of heaven, and Mars presides in war. To this
last, when they resolve on a battle, they commonly devote the spoil.
If they prove victorious, they offer up all the cattle taken, and set
apart the rest of the plunder in a place appointed for that purpose;
it is common in many provinces to see these monuments of offerings
piled up in consecrated places. Nay, it rarely happens that any one
shows so great a disregard of religion as either to conceal the plunder
or pillage the public oblations; and the severest punishments are
inflicted on such offenders.</p>

<p>The Gauls fancy themselves to be descended from the god Pluto;
which, it seems, is an established tradition among the Druids. For
this reason they compute the time by nights, not by days; and, in
the observance of birthdays, new moons, and the beginning of the
year, always commence the celebration from the preceding night.
In one custom they differ from almost all other nations, that they
never suffer their children to come openly into their presence until
they are old enough to bear arms; for the appearance of a son in
public with his father before he has reached the age of manhood is
accounted dishonorable.</p>

<p>Whatever fortune the woman brings, the husband is obliged to
equal it out of his own estate. This whole sum, with its annual
product, is left untouched, and falls always to the share of the survivor.
The men have power of life and death over their wives and
children; and, when any father of a family of illustrious rank dies,
his relations assemble, and, on the least ground of suspicion, put even
his wives to the torture like slaves. If they are found guilty, iron
and fire are employed to torment and destroy them. Their funerals
are magnificent and sumptuous, according to their quality. Everything
that was dear to the deceased, even animals, are thrown into
the pile; and, formerly, such of their slaves and clients as they
loved most sacrificed themselves at the funeral of their lord.</p>

<p>The Germans differ widely in their manners from the Gauls; for
neither have they Druids to preside in religious affairs, nor do they
trouble themselves about sacrifices. They acknowledge no gods but
those that they can see, and by whose power they are apparently
benefited: the sun, the moon, fire. Of others they know nothing,
not even by report. Their whole life is addicted to hunting and
war; and from their infancy they are inured to fatigue and hardships.
Agriculture is little regarded among them, as they live mostly
on milk, cheese, and the flesh of animals. Nor has any man lands
of his own, or distinguished by fixed boundaries. The magistrates
and those in authority portion out yearly to every canton and family
such a quantity of land, and in what part of the country they think
proper; and the year following remove them to some other spot.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
<p>Many reasons are assigned for this practice; lest, seduced by habit
and continuance, they should learn to prefer pillage to war; lest a
desire of enlarging their possessions should gain ground, and prompt
the stronger to expel the weaker; lest they should become curious
in their buildings, in order to guard against the extremes of heat
and cold; lest avarice should get footing among them, whence
spring factions and discords; in fine, to preserve contentment and
equanimity among the people, when they find their possessions nothing
inferior to those of the most powerful.</p>

<p>It is accounted honorable for states to have the country all around
them lie waste and depopulated; for they think it an argument of
valor to expel their neighbors, and suffer none to settle near them;
at the same time that they are themselves also the safer, as having
nothing to apprehend from sudden incursions. When a state is engaged
in war, either offensive or defensive, they make choice of magistrates
to preside in it, whom they arm with the power of life and
death. In time of peace there are no public magistrates; but the
chiefs of the several provinces and clans administer justice, and decide
differences within their respective limits. Robbery has nothing
infamous in it when committed without the territories of the state
to which they belong; they even pretend that it serves to exercise
their youth, and prevent the growth of sloth. The laws of hospitality
are held inviolable among them. All that fly to them for refuge,
on whatever account, are sure of protection and defence.”—<span class="smcap">Duncan.</span></p>
</div>


<p><b>Sallust</b> (86-34 B.C.).—Another historian, whose name is
as familiar as Cæsar’s to classical students, is Caius Sallustius
Crispus, popularly known as Sallust. From his native town
Amiternum, in the country of the Sabines, he came to Rome,
ambitious of public honors, and gradually worked his way up
to a seat in the senate. Alleged immorality, however, caused
his expulsion from that body, and not until he had rendered
important service to Cæsar in the civil war did he recover his
good standing. Cæsar made him governor of the rich province
of Numidia (46 B.C.), which Sallust pretty thoroughly
plundered during his one year of office, returning to Rome
with fabulous riches. It was fortunate for him that, when a
Numidian commission arrived to prosecute him for extortion,
his powerful patron interposed to save him from punishment.</p>

<p>On the assassination of Cæsar, Sallust retired from public
life and devoted part of his ill-gotten gains to the erection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
a splendid mansion on one of the seven hills. It was surrounded
by lovely pleasure-grounds, adorned with baths, statues,
and other magnificent works of art, prominent among
which, on exquisitely chiselled columns, rose a temple, paved
in mosaic, and set off with Grecian marbles. “The Gardens
of Sallust” were preferred by many of the Roman emperors
to the imperial palace itself.</p>

<p>Here or at his Tiburtine villa, our author, thoroughly convinced
of the vanity of political honors, and filled with remorse
for his youthful indiscretions, spent the last nine years
of his life in the compilation of historical works which give us
a high opinion of his abilities. His first effort was “the Conspiracy
of Catiline,” the facts of which were vividly impressed
upon his memory, since, when a student at Rome, he was a
witness of its thrilling scenes. “The Jugurthine War,” which
followed, treats of the struggle which the Roman people carried
on with Jugurtha, king of Numidia. This unscrupulous
prince had made his way to an undivided throne over the
murdered bodies of his two cousins, allies of the Romans, securing
impunity for a time by buying up the senate. Having,
however, caused the assassination of another kinsman in the
very streets of Rome, whither he had been summoned, on the
pledge of the public faith, to expose those who had taken his
bribes, he was ordered to quit Italy. It was on leaving the
capital that Jugurtha, looking back, uttered those words so
significant of the prevalent corruption: “O venal city and
destined soon to perish, if you can but find a purchaser!”</p>

<p>A Roman army followed him into Africa; but little was
effected until the consul Metellus assumed the command, and,
proof against Numidian gold, prosecuted the war in earnest.
After five years’ continuance, it was successfully terminated
by Marius. Sallust’s history ends with the betrayal of Jugurtha
to the Romans, and the triumph of the consul Marius,
“on whom the hopes of the state were then placed.” Plutarch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
adds that, after figuring in the procession, Jugurtha was set
upon by the people, who tore the rings from his ears and even
stripped him of his clothes; then he was pushed into a damp
dungeon to starve, shuddering as he cried to the bystanders
with a maniacal laugh, “How cold is this bath of yours!”</p>

<p>Another work of Sallust was a History of Rome from 78 to
66 B.C., fragments of which remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sallust’s Style</span>, modelled after that of Thucydides, is sententious,
energetic, and an improvement on the original in
clearness. Condensation without obscurity is its crowning
excellence; and its finish, though too plainly showing marks
of labor, is always attractive.</p>

<p>The forte of Sallust lay in delineating character; his portraits
of Catiline and Jugurtha are as vivid as if the men
themselves stood before us. Especially striking are his pictures
of remorse. Catiline, who murdered his own son to induce
an infamous beauty to become his wife, “at peace with
neither gods nor men, finds no comfort either waking or sleeping;
his complexion is pale, his eyes haggard, his walk sometimes
quick and sometimes slow, and distraction is apparent
in every look.” Jugurtha, red with the blood of many victims,
“fears his subjects and his enemies alike, is ever on the
watch, starts from his sleep to seize his arms, and is so agitated
by terror as to appear under the influence of madness.”</p>

<p>Sallust also affects the moralist, and throughout his works
is as loud in the praises of virtue as in his life he was careless
of her interests. From “the Jugurthine War” we take
an interesting account of the</p>


<p class="center">CAPTURE OF A NUMIDIAN FORT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not far from the river Mulucha, which separated the kingdoms
of Jugurtha and Bocchus, there stood, in the midst of a plain, a
small fort, on a rock of considerable breadth, and of prodigious
height, naturally as steep on every side as art or labor could render
it; it had no access, except at one place, and that was by means of
a narrow path. As the king’s treasure was deposited in this place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
Marius exerted his utmost efforts to reduce it; and succeeded, more
by accident than by prudent management.</p>

<p>The castle was abundantly provided with men, arms, provisions,
and a spring of water; its situation rendered it impossible to make
use of mounds and turrets, and the machinery usually employed in
a siege; the path to it was very narrow, with a precipice on each
side. The moving galleries were pushed forward with infinite hazard,
and to no purpose; for, when they advanced toward the garrison,
they were either destroyed by fire or crushed by prodigious
stones. The soldiers could neither maintain their footing nor make
use of their batteries without exposing themselves to continual danger.
The most adventurous were either slain or wounded, and the
rest were greatly discouraged.</p>

<p>Marius, having thus spent many toilsome days, now hesitated
whether he should abandon his enterprise, which had proved unsuccessful,
or wait the interposition of fortune, which had so frequently
befriended him. While these reflections day and night occupied his
mind, a Ligurian, a common soldier of the auxiliary cohorts, who
had gone out of the camp in search of water, happened to observe,
not far from the opposite side of the castle, some periwinkles creeping
among the rocks; gathering one, then another, and still climbing
to procure more, he was led insensibly almost to the top of
the mountain, where, perceiving all was quiet in that quarter, the
natural desire of viewing unknown objects prompted him to proceed.</p>

<p>It chanced that an oak-tree, of considerable magnitude, here grew
out of the side of the rock, and, bending its trunk downward near
the root, then taking a turn, mounted upward, as is natural to trees
in such situations.</p>

<p>By the help of this, the Ligurian, laying hold of the branches of
the tree or of the prominences of the rock, was at length enabled to
survey the whole plan of the castle, without being disturbed by the
Numidians, who were all engaged on that side on which the attack
had been made. Having carefully examined whatever he thought
would be useful to him in the execution of his design, he returned
the same way; not hastily, as he went up, but pausing at every
step, and observing everything with the utmost care.</p>

<p>On his return to the camp, he hastened to Marius, informed him
of what he had done, pressed him to make an attempt on the castle
on that side where he himself had mounted, and promised that he
would lead the way, and be the first to face the danger. Marius despatched
some of those who attended him, accompanied by the Ligurian,
to examine the spot; and, although their reports varied as
to the facility or the difficulty of the undertaking, the consul, encouraged
by the hope of success, determined to make the attempt.
He accordingly selected, from among the trumpeters and cornet-blowers
of the line, five of the most active and enterprising men, together
with four centurions to support them, and, putting the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
under the command of the Ligurian, he ordered them to be in readiness
to set out on the following day.</p>

<p>At the time appointed the party left the camp, having previously
taken such measures as were necessary for the expedition. The centurions,
according to the instructions which they had received from
their guide, had changed their arms and dress, and marched with
their heads and feet bare, that they might have the freer prospect,
and climb with more facility. Their swords and bucklers were slung
across their shoulders; the latter, of the Numidian kind, and covered
with hides, as well for the sake of lightness, as that all noise might
be avoided if they struck against the rock.</p>

<p>The Ligurian, leading the way, fixed cords about the stones, and
such roots of trees as appeared proper for the purpose, to assist the
soldiers in climbing; stretching his hand, from time to time, to such
as were discouraged at so rugged a march. When the ascent was
more steep than ordinary, he would send them up before him unarmed,
and then follow himself with their arms. Wherever it appeared
more dangerous to climb, he went foremost; and, by ascending
and descending several times, encouraged the rest to follow him,
and retired to make way for them. At length, after much tedious
labor, they gained the castle, which was quite deserted on that side,
the Numidians being all employed in the opposite quarter.</p>

<p>When Marius was informed of the success of the Ligurian, although
he had kept the garrison employed the whole day by a continued
attack, he now, encouraging the soldiers, sallied from under
the moving galleries, and, drawing up his men in the form of a
shell, rushed forward to the castle; while the slingers and archers
poured their volleys from a distance, and the engines incessantly
played on the besieged. The Numidians, who had often before
broken to pieces and even burned the Roman galleries, did not now
defend themselves within their battlements, but passed whole days
and nights without their walls; they railed at the efforts of the Romans,
upbraided Marius with madness, and in the height of their exultation
threatened to make our men slaves of Jugurtha.</p>

<p>While both sides were warmly engaged in this vigorous struggle
for glory and empire on the one hand, and life and liberty on the
other, the trumpets on a sudden sounded in the enemy’s rear. The
women and children, who had come out to see the engagement, first
fled in dismay; after them, such as were nearest the walls; and at
last the whole, armed and unarmed, fairly gave way. The Romans
now pressed onward with greater vigor, overthrowing the enemy, and
wounding most of them; then, advancing over the heaps of slain,
they flew to the walls, all thirsting for glory, and each striving to be
foremost, without regard to plunder. Thus did accidental success
justify the rashness of Marius, while his imprudence contributed to
heighten his glory.”</p>

<p><b>Cornelius Nepos</b> (74-24 B.C.), though inferior to the writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
just treated, deserves mention for his “Lives of Eminent
Commanders,” his only extant work. These sketches, especially
the biography of Pomponius Atticus, are clearly written
and furnish valuable information respecting the times to
which they relate; but Nepos was not an accurate compiler,
and dependence cannot always be placed on his statements.
As a specimen of his style, we quote from his “Lives”.</p>


<p class="center">THE CHARACTER OF ALCIBIADES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nature seems to have tried in him what she could do. For it is
agreed upon among all who have written about him, that nobody
was more extraordinary than he, either in vices or in virtues; being
born in a very great city, of a great family, much the handsomest
man of his time, fit for all things, and abounding in judgment for
the management of affairs. For he was a very great commander,
both by sea and land; so eloquent that he mightily prevailed in
speaking; and such was the plausibility of his elocution and language
that in haranguing nobody was able to stand before him.</p>

<p>The same man, when occasion required, was laborious, hardy, generous,
splendid no less in his equipage than his diet, affable, fawning,
very cunningly serving the times. The same, when he had unbent
himself, and there was no reason why he should take upon him
any labor of thought, was found to be luxurious, dissolute, and intemperate,
in so much that all wondered that in the same man there
should be so much unlikeness to himself, and natures so different.”—<span class="smcap">John Clarke.</span></p>
</div>


<h4>POETS OF THE CICERONIAN PERIOD.</h4>


<p><b>Lucretius</b> (95-55 B.C.).—Meanwhile Italy produced two
poets of high rank, Lucretius and Catullus. Of Lucretius we
have little trustworthy information. A native of Italy, he appears,
in accordance with the common practice, to have studied
philosophy at Athens, where he became the classmate of
Memmius. From his poetry, we may infer his indifference to
all things transient, alike to social pleasures and the stormy
sea of politics that surged around him; his life was probably
one of deep thought, tinged with sadness. In dignity he was
a true Roman; in sympathy for his kind, a true man. With
nature he must have held frequent converse, for Homer alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
of ancient writers excels him in description. His life ended
with suicide.</p>

<p>The only work of Lucretius was what Macaulay styles “the
finest didactic poem in any language,” “On the Nature of
Things.” It was dedicated to his school-friend Memmius, at
whose suggestion it is said to have been written. The old
story that, having been crazed by a love-philter administered
through the jealousy of his wife, the poet composed this work
during the temporary returns of reason, is now discredited as
a fabrication of later times.</p>

<p>The poem is divided into six books, and embodies the dogmas
of Epicurus, which Lucretius vivified with the spirit of
poetry and beautified with its most attractive drapery. Pleasure,
the chief end of existence, is to be sought by banishing
care and distressing thoughts. God created not; but eternal
atoms, variously and ceaselessly active, constitute all existing
things. The soul dies with the body; it behooves us, therefore,
to make the most of the little time allotted us, by dividing
it between moderate enjoyment and philosophical contemplation.
(<i>See Masson’s “The Atomic Theory of Lucretius.”</i>)</p>

<p>Lucretius also accounted for the origin of the universe,
whose government by a Divine Being he scouted; for that of
plants, men, and animals, teaching the survival of the fittest;
for that of language and the arts. To elevate his readers
above degrading superstitions and the cowardly fear of death
is his primary aim; and “the constant presence of this practical
purpose imparts to his words that peculiar tone of impassioned
earnestness to which there is no parallel in ancient
literature.” In one of many passages on the subject, he thus
speaks of</p>

<p>Lucretius reasons plausibly, but on some points, it is too
evident, unsatisfactorily even to himself. His work contains
much that is worthy of praise, but this only makes its atheis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>tical
tendencies more dangerous. It was left unfinished at
the poet’s death, to be revised and edited by other hands.</p>

<p>The style of Lucretius is not uniformly harmonious; some
of his verses lack polish, and he inclines to antique forms.
Yet it is dignified, luminous, and animated; glows with all the
poet’s enthusiasm, and is marked by tenderness and pathos.
The pictures drawn are so real as to awaken the emotions
that would be experienced on beholding the originals. Schlegel
gives Lucretius high praise: “As a painter and worshipper
of nature, he is the first of all the poets of antiquity.”</p>

<p><b>Catullus</b> (87-54 B.C.).—Verona in Cisalpine Gaul gave
birth to Catullus, the first great Roman lyrist. It was no
doubt to avail himself of the superior advantages Rome offered,
that while still in the greenness of his youth he exchanged
his provincial quarters for the capital. Here we catch occasional
glimpses of him—moving among the <i>élite</i> as the equal
of men like Nepos, Hortensius, and Cicero; or as the reckless
sensualist throwing himself at the feet of some dissolute siren.</p>

<p>Upon the notorious “Lesbia,” who stole, our poet sung,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The charms most rare of every fair</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To frame a perfect whole,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Catullus wasted alike his love and the finest lyrics of which
the Latin boasts. The coquettish beauty at first gloried in her
conquest of Rome’s most popular poet, and appears for a time
to have been true. Then she grew cold, and cast him off for
new admirers. But Catullus, though outraged by her fickleness,
could not overcome his unworthy passion:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I curse her every hour sincerely,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet hang me—but I love her dearly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last, however, he renounced his faithless mistress, bidding
her adieu in an ode which closes with one of his most beautiful
similes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nor give that love a thought which I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So nursed for thee in days gone by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now by thy guile slain in an hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en as some little wilding flower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That on the meadow’s border blushed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is by the passing ploughshare crushed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Catullus spent his hours of relaxation at his villa in the
suburbs of the Latian town of Ti’bur, or at his favorite Sirmio
on a lovely lake in northern Italy, the subject of one of his
most graceful odes. Toward the close of his life, in the hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
of refilling a purse which his extravagance had depleted, he
went to Bithynia in Asia Minor as a staff-officer of the prætor
Memmius, to whom Lucretius inscribed his poem. But in
consequence of the selfishness of his superior, Catullus came
back with wallet still lighter. Of two friends who went to
Spain on a similar errand, he archly inquired:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And have you netted—worse than worst—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A good deal less than you disbursed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like me, who following about</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My prætor, was—in fact—cleaned out?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The death of a brother to whom he was devotedly attached
plunged Catullus in grief; and now with nothing to live for,
sated with worldly pleasure, in which he found the vanity of
vanities, he longed for the fate that soon overtook him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Style of Catullus</span>, called by the ancients “the Accomplished,”
is lively, graceful, and vigorous; he writes in the
language of nature, and excels in suiting his words to the sentiments
expressed. The musical measures of the Greeks,
adapted by him to his native tongue, lent intensity to his
words, and there were “lutes in his very lines.” From the
Greek writers, particularly Sappho and Callimachus of Alexandria,
he borrowed largely. One of his odes to Lesbia is evidently
an imitation of Sappho’s celebrated love-song quoted
on p. 169:—</p>

<p>His book of poems, 116 in number, was dedicated to Cornelius
Nepos. Their subjects are as various as the metres in
which they are written, for they reflect the passing emotions
of the poet, now lighted with gayety, now clouded with sorrow,
anon ablaze with love.</p>

<p>Among the other pieces of Catullus must be mentioned his
cutting satires, in which even Cæsar was not spared; his exquisite
<i>epithalamia</i>, or marriage-hymns; and the “Atys,” a
weird poem remarkable for its metrical effects. Our poet’s

<h4>POETRY OF THE AUGUSTAN AGE.</h4>

<p>As prose reached its highest development in the last years
of the Republic, so many causes contributed to perfect Latin
verse in the reign of the first Roman emperor, Augustus.
Secured upon the throne by his triumph at Actium (31 B.C.),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
Augustus pursued a conciliatory course, with a view to winning
the love of his subjects, and he was eminently successful.
All classes, tired of civil war and its attendant proscriptions
and massacres, hailed with delight the return of peace;
and under the patronage of the emperor, seconded by his
minister Mæcenas, poetry revived.</p>

<p>Augustus was as fortunate in finding at Rome a number of
youthful poets, many of them in humble circumstances and of
provincial origin, as in the possession of a minister who could
appreciate and foster their talents. Mæcenas knew the value
of genius too well to let it die of neglect; and his name, as
the patron of art and letters, has passed into a proverb. His
luxurious gardens were the haunt of poets and savants, and
round his sumptuous table sat an inspired circle who poured
their grateful tributes into the ears of their master and his.</p>

<p>Thus the munificence of Augustus and Mæcenas, themselves
both critics and writers, combined with the political
quiet that gave leisure for literary pursuits, to make their
period the golden age of poetry. Prose, on the other hand,
declined. Political eloquence was powerless in the face of
despotism; while the veracious historian must needs tread a
dangerous path, or seal his lips.</p>

<p>The poets of the Augustan era were deficient, as a rule, in
that creative genius which characterized the age of Pericles
in Greece, their works being rather the fruits of art and industry.
A long and careful training, in which Greek studies
played a prominent part, prepared them for their high profession;
Horace tells us that at the age of twenty-three he
was still “seeking the truth among the groves of Academus.”
Works on various subjects could now be consulted in the
public libraries of Rome; and Alexandrian models helped to
mould the literary taste of the day. (<i>Compare Sellar’s “Roman
Poets of the Augustan Age.”</i>)</p>


<p><b>Virgil.</b>—In the little village of Andes near Mantua, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
15th of October, B.C. 70, Rome’s greatest poet, Virgil (Publius
Virgilius Maro), first saw the light. His boyhood was
spent on the banks of the winding Mincio in a quiet round
of rural pursuits; his father, as owner of a small farm, being
among those whom the poet subsequently pictured as the
happiest of men.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_p356" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_p356.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Romans of the Augustan Age</span> (Becker’s “Gallus.”)</div>
</div>

<p>Alive to the importance of education, Virgil’s parents set
aside a portion of their slender means to provide for his instruction;
and when he reached the age of twelve, his father
entered him in a school at Cremona. In his seventeenth
year he went to Rome, and there prosecuted the higher studies,
familiarizing himself with the Greek poets, and spending
his leisure in the composition of lyric pieces. Having com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>pleted
his education, Virgil returned to his native place,
where, amid the natural attractions that surrounded him, he
conceived the idea of rivalling Theocritus in bucolic poetry,
and in 42 B.C. began his Eclogues.</p>

<p>After the victory of the Triumvirs in the civil war, the
lands about Cremona and Mantua were divided among the
soldiers who had served against Brutus, and the estate of
Virgil, neutral though he had been, was taken from him. On
the poet’s application to Octavius, however, it was restored,
and in one of his Eclogues he gave utterance to his sincere
gratitude. Shortly after, Virgil was ejected again, and this
time narrowly escaped with his life by swimming the Mincio.
Nor does he appear to have ever been reinstated. Octavius,
however, loaded him with favors; and a house in Rome near
the palace of his friend Mæcenas, with a lovely villa in the
suburbs of Naples, where the climate agreed better with his
delicate constitution than the damp air of the north, reconciled
him to the loss of his boyhood’s home.</p>

<p>The Eclogues, published about 37 B.C., established Virgil’s
reputation as a pastoral poet, and gained him no mean place
among the literary and political celebrities that crowded
the house of Mæcenas. It was by the advice of this statesman
that the poet undertook the most finished and original
of all his productions,—the Georgics,—a work which, though
only about 2200 lines in length, occupied him for seven years.</p>

<p>Having declared in this poem that “he would wed Cæsar’s
glories to an epic strain,” Virgil was held to his promise by
the emperor, at whose solicitation he gave the rest of his life
(eleven years) to the composition of the Æneid. In this
great epic, like the Odyssey a sequel to the Iliad, the origin
of Rome is traced back to ancient Troy, and the genealogy of
Augustus to her greatest surviving hero, “the pious Æneas.”
Death stopped the poet’s pen when three years’ labor was
yet necessary, in his estimation, to perfect his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p>It appears that in the year 19 B.C. Virgil undertook a tour
through Greece and Asia Minor, to acquaint himself with the
geography of the countries described in the Æneid; but
meeting Augustus at Athens, he changed his plans and started
with the emperor for Rome. On the way he was seized
with a mortal illness, and only lived to reach the harbor of
Brundisium in southern Italy. On his death-bed, Virgil besought
his friends to bring him the manuscript of his epic,
that he might consign it to the flames; but they wisely saved
a masterpiece which the modesty of its author would have
condemned to oblivion.</p>

<p>Virgil was interred at Naples. A simple vault, overgrown
with ivy and wild myrtle, still marks his grave. On a marble
slab set in the rock opposite is the inscription which Dryden
has thus rendered:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I sung flocks, tillage, heroes: Mantua gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Me life; Brundisium, death; Naples, a grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Virgil has been described as a tall, dark-complexioned man,
careless of his dress, and with awkward country airs. His life
was that of a student; and despite the fact that he was a martyr
to dyspepsia and pulmonary disease, he did not allow his
delicate health to interfere with his literary labors. Of gentle,
unassuming manners, he would fly from the admiring
crowds that followed him in the streets; and none would
have inferred from his appearance or conversation that he
was a great poet. He was more than a great poet—he was
a pure, unselfish, honest man, uncontaminated by the prevailing
vices. Not the least among his virtues was filial piety.
His countrymen felt how great and noble he was, when they
rose in the theatre and paid him equal honor with the emperor
himself.</p>

<p>Had he lived, it was Virgil’s purpose, after completing the
Æneid, to study philosophy, the love of which he had imbibed
in early life from the verses of Lucretius. The investigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
of truth was his highest aim; and there are reasons for believing
that he had in mind the preparation of a grand philosophical
poem that might have cast into the shade the
stately treatise “On the Nature of Things.”</p>

<p>Such liberality had Virgil experienced from his friends that
he left a fortune of $400,000, to be divided, as he never married,
among his brother, Augustus, Mæcenas, and others of
his associates.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Eclogues.</span>—Virgil was the first Roman writer to cultivate
pastoral poetry, and his Eclogues (<i>selections</i>), or more
properly Bucolics (<i>shepherd poems</i>), are mostly dialogues, in
imitation of the idyls of Theocritus. Various subjects are
charmingly discussed by imaginary shepherds, in whom one
sometimes recognizes the poet and his friends.</p>

<p>The least understood of Virgil’s Eclogues is the one entitled
“Pollio,” from the name of the consul to whom it is addressed.
It was written B.C. 40, and predicts the coming of
a wondrous Child, whose birth would usher in a golden age
of peace and happiness. Some have seen in this child an unconscious
allusion to the Babe of Bethlehem, whose advent
the Sibylline oracles are believed to have foretold. Perhaps
Virgil had heard of the Hebrew prophecies indirectly through
the Alexandrian Greeks, and recast them in Latin verse;
perhaps it was but a Roman infant—Pollio’s child—whose
birth he sung in an exaggerated strain. However this may
be, we may remember that the heathen as well as the Jewish
world at this time expected a great reformer, who should restore
the innocence and bliss of by-gone ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Georgics.</span>—Having shown his powers in the Eclogues,
Virgil was not unwilling to put them to a further
proof, when Mæcenas suggested a work on husbandry, which
should dignify that ancient art and revive a love for the simple
pursuits of the fathers of the Republic.</p>

<p>Taking Hesiod’s “Works and Days” as his model, he added
the artistic Georgics (<i>agricultural poem</i>) to the works of
Cato and Varro on rural life. No less elevated in tone than
theirs, it possesses an additional attraction in its dress of
verse, glows with the author’s love of nature, and displays his
ardent zeal to check the national decay. Virgil labored upon
the Georgics for seven years, it being his habit to rise betimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
and dictate in the early morning verses which he spent the
rest of the day in polishing and condensing.</p>

<p>The Georgics is a didactic poem, and as such, with the
work of Lucretius, represents the only department in which
the Romans excelled both the Greeks and all modern nations.
The first of its four books is devoted to tillage; it
gives directions for ploughing (early and often, was Virgil’s
motto), sowing, and fertilizing, and explains the signs of the
weather. We learn from it that the pests of the modern
farmer were not unknown to the old Roman husbandman:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“With ponderous roller smooth the level floor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bind with chalky cement o’er and o’er;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest springing weeds expose thy want of art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And worn in many a chink the surface part:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There builds the field-mouse underneath the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And loads her little barn with plunder crowned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There works the mole along her dark abode,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There the wise ant that dreads the wants of age.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Arboriculture is treated minutely in the second book, the
vine receiving the principal share of attention. Here we
have the most beautiful of those digressions which lend an
enchanting variety to the style of the Georgics—the poet’s
glowing eulogy of his native land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p>

<p>Æneas, the son of Venus by the Trojan shepherd Anchi’ses,
escaped from burning Troy with his aged father, little
son, and household gods. He lay concealed for a time in the
mountains; and, when the victorious Greeks had all withdrawn,
took ship with the remnant of his people to found a
new Troy in the west. After seven years of hardships and
mistakes, the Trojans embark from Sicily for “the Hesperian
shore.”</p>

<p>Here the Æneid takes up the story. In the first book we
see the Trojan fleet driven by a tempest, sent at Juno’s solicitation,
on the opposite coast of Africa, near the rising walls
of Carthage. Dido, its queen, whom the murder of her husband
Sichæus by her unnatural brother had driven from Tyre,
receives the strangers hospitably, and by the strategy of Venus
conceives a passionate love for Æneas. At her request
the Trojan prince tells the pathetic story—the fall of his native
city through the wiles of the Greeks, and his subsequent
trials.</p>

<p>Æneas returns Dido’s love, but only at last to betray his
confiding hostess, and fly with his vessels under cover of the
night, in obedience to a warning from Mercury, the messenger
of Jove. Too “pious” to disregard the heavenly command,
he left Dido to end her sorrow on the funeral pyre.</p>

<p>After a temporary sojourn in Sicily, where he celebrates
funeral games to his father’s memory, Æneas at length reaches
Cumæ in Italy, and at once seeks the Sibyl. She informs
him that his trials are not over, and takes him to the lower
world that he may hold an interview with his father Anchises.
There he descries among other shades the injured Dido, to
whom he endeavors to excuse his conduct.</p>

<div class="verse indent0">And through the mist her semblance knew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span></div>
<div class="verse indent0">Like one who spies, or thinks he spies,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Through flickering clouds the new moon rise,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">By heaven, by all that dead men keep</div>
<div class="verse indent0">In reverence here ’mid darkness deep,</div>

<div class="verse indent10"><span class="smcap">Conington.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Dido averts her eyes “that neither smiled nor wept,”
and moves away in silence to join Sichæus, who “gives her
love for love.”</p>

<p>Æneas learns from the lips of Anchises the future of his
race, and beholds the shadowy forms of kings, generals, and
statesmen that are to shed glory on the Roman name. “Augustus
Cæsar, god by birth,” figures, as we should expect, the
proudest of the throng. At last he espies the great Marcellus,
“the Sword of Rome,” glittering in the spoils of the Punic
War; and by his side</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In answer to the inquiry of Æneas, Anchises tells his son
that this youth is “our own Marcellus,” and eulogizes his virtues.
Thus Virgil immortalized the name of a Roman prince
of great promise, son of Octavia, the emperor’s sister, whose
premature death had filled the Roman world with sorrow.
When, at the request of Augustus, the poet read this portion
of his epic before the royal family, all were moved to tears,
and the bereaved mother fainted. She afterward showed her
appreciation of Virgil’s genius by presenting him about $400
for each of the twenty-seven lines. The passage is well worth
repeating here:—</p>

<p>From Cumæ the Trojan chief sails to Latium, the land of
his destiny, and there he receives from King Lati’nus the
promise of his daughter Lavinia’s hand. But this provokes a
war with Turnus, a neighboring prince, to whom Lavinia had
been secretly plighted by the queen-mother. Not until he
had subdued Turnus and his Latin allies did Æneas make
Lavinia his own and rule as king of Latium. The poem
ends with the fall of Turnus in a duel between the rival
chiefs. To finish the story, Alba Longa was built by Æneas’
son Iulus, from whose royal line in later ages sprung
Romulus, founder of Rome, the <i>Julian</i> family, and their
great hero <i>Julius</i> Caesar.</p>

<p>The passion of Dido, as portrayed in the fourth book of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>

<p>Virgil’s epic was the pride of his countrymen, who, with a
pardonable national vanity, pronounced it superior to Homer’s.
Tenderness, grace, elegance, rhythmical perfection,
brilliance of description, it certainly possesses; yet, with all
its beauties, it is not faultless. We miss the wonderful imagination
that plays through every page of the Iliad; indeed,
Homer furnished the originals of many of its most striking
figures. Nor did Virgil disdain levying on Latin authors also.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
Whatever recommended itself to him in the poetry of others,
he borrowed for his own. And yet he must not be regarded
as a plagiarist; doubtless it was his intention to enshrine in
a national epic literary monuments of all the great minds of
his country.</p>

<p>Æneas, his hero, too often appears as the boaster or the heartless
hypocrite, rather than as the ideal of greatness and piety
it was designed to draw. The author himself seems to have
felt the inferiority of his epic to the Iliad, and hence his wish
to destroy it. We are told that it was first written in prose;
and then the artist, having a clear conception of the whole,
threw different portions into verse as the spirit moved him.
(<i>See Nettleship’s “Introduction to the Study of the Æneid.”</i>)</p>


<p><b>Horace</b> (65-8 B.C.).—The great lyric poet of Rome was
Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus), a freedman’s son, of
Venusia on the roaring Au’fidus. That he might enjoy the
best educational advantages, his father took him to Rome at
the early age of twelve. Here he was placed in charge of a
famous schoolmaster, called by his pupils “the Flogger;”
under whose rod the country lad made the acquaintance of
Ennius and Homer. To the watchful care and liberality of
his parent, who remained to guard him from the temptations
of the metropolis, he gratefully acknowledged that he owed
everything.</p>

<p>Horace was at Athens, finishing his course, when Cæsar
fell beneath the daggers of the conspirators. With a number
of hot-headed fellow-students he promptly espoused the cause
of Brutus the Liberator, and served in the civil war as military
tribune. But Horace’s courage could not stand the touch
of cold steel; he ignominiously fled from the field of Philippi,
and his estate was confiscated as a reward for his patriotism.
Poverty now compelled him to take a clerkship at Rome;
and to add to his slender income he began writing verses.
This brought him into notice, and in 38 B.C. he had the hon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>or
of an introduction to the social circle that gathered round
Mæcenas. His little farm, fifteen miles from Tibur, the ruins
of which are still pointed out to tourists, was the gift of his
munificent patron.</p>

<p>This “Sabine farm” was at once Horace’s joy and pride.
Between Rome and Tibur, therefore, he made frequent journeys,
and the simple country-folk, won by his affability, hailed
with delight the occasions when, tired of city excitements, he
sought relaxation among them. Beset by the throng of gossips
and favor-seekers who haunted his footsteps as the friend
of Mæcenas, Horace in his Sixth Satire breaks out into enthusiastic
praises of his rural home, with its simple fare and freedom
from annoyances:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Indeed I know not.’—’How you joke,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Then, pr’ythee, where are Cæsar’s bands</div>

<p>The loss of his friend Virgil cast a shadow over Horace’s
latter years. His own death was sudden. A short month
before, Mæcenas had breathed his last; and thus the promise
of the poet not to survive his patron was almost literally fulfilled.
In an ode to Mæcenas, Horace had sung,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Should you, alas! be snatched away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore, ah! wherefore should I stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My value lost, no longer whole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And but possessing half my soul?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One day (believe the sacred oath)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall lead the funeral pomp of both;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thee to Pluto’s dark abode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thee I’ll tread the dreary road.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The remains of the poet were laid by the side of his friend;
and thus, devoted to each other in life, they slept together in
the grave. (<i>Read Milman’s “Life of Horace.”</i>)</p>

<p>Horace, in his youth, was a free liver, a voluptuary; such,
indeed, were the men of his day, Virgil alone excepted. Time,
however, corrected his tastes, and at the close of his life we
find him playing the part of the moralist. If there is much to
condemn in his character, there is also much to admire,—his
even temper, contented disposition, and independent spirit.
Quick to resent an affront, he was as ready to forgive an injury.
His friends found him ever a genial, frank, warm-hearted
companion.</p>

<p>As to his personal appearance, we may judge from his own
accounts that he was gray in advance of his years, short, corpulent,
and withal blear-eyed. This last defect furnished
Augustus with a ready joke, when he had Horace on one side
and the asthmatic Virgil on the other: “I sit between sighs
and tears,” he used to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Works of Horace.</span>—The earliest poetical efforts of Horace
were Satires, which, though written in hexameter verse,
he called <i>prose-poems</i>. Holding up to contempt the follies of
fashionable society, fortune-hunting, extravagance, avarice,
etc., they pleased the Romans and rapidly grew in popularity.
But Horace merely derides, he does not chastise, the vices of
his day, evidently deeming ridicule a more effective weapon
than denunciation.</p>

<p>In his Epodes, Horace aimed his blows at individuals with
something like the force of Archilochus. But personal satire
was not the author’s forte, and his Epodes are hardly equal
to his other productions.</p>

<p>It is to his Odes, in the lyric metres of Alcæus and Sappho,
whose poetry he not only loved, but recast after his own ideas
in his native tongue, that Horace owes his renown. Always
brief and to the point, clear and elegant in their condensation,
graceful, spicy, true to nature, these poems have been
read with pleasure for nineteen centuries. They deal with a
great variety of subjects—the grand as well as the commonplace;
and, whatever the theme, their author is equally admirable.
He paints pictures of moral beauty and sublimity
with singular impressiveness. Nowhere in the classics is a
nobler character sketched than that drawn by Horace of a
man firm in the cause of justice (Book III., 3). Byron presents
it in an English dress:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“The man of firm and noble soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No factious clamors can control;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No threat’ning tyrant’s darkling brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Can swerve him from his just intent:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gales the warring waves which plough</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">By Auster on the billows spent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To curb the Adriatic main,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would awe his fixed, determined mind in vain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Ay, and the red right arm of Jove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hurtling his lightnings from above,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">With all his terrors then unfurled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">He would unmoved, unawed behold:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The flames of an expiring world</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Again in crashing chaos rolled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In vast promiscuous ruin hurled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Might light his glorious funeral pile:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still dauntless, ’mid the wreck of earth he’d smile.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Horace began writing his odes at the age of thirty-five, and
was seven years in completing the first three books; they
were issued 23 B.C. That he designed them to include all
his lyric productions is evident from the following ode, with
which the third book closes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And now ’tis done: more durable than brass</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My monument shall be, and raise its head</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O’er royal pyramids: it shall not dread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Corroding rain or angry Boreas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor the long lapse of immemorial time.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I shall not wholly die: large residue</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shall ’scape the queen of funerals. Ever new</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My after-fame shall grow, while pontiffs climb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With silent maids the Capitolian height.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Born,’ men will say, ‘where Aufidus is loud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where Daunus, scant of streams, beneath him bowed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rustic tribes, from dimness he waxed bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First of his race to wed the Æolian lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To notes of Italy.’ Put glory on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My own Melpomene, by genius won,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crown me of thy grace with Delphic bay.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent30"><span class="smcap">Conington.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The odes of the fourth book were written at the request of
Augustus, who commissioned the favorite poet to celebrate
the victories of his step-sons over a German tribe. After publishing
the original three books, Horace wrote his Epistles,
the most finished of all his works. They bear the ripe fruits
of his experience, and are full of wise reflections which do
credit to his knowledge of men and manners. Sprightliness
and wit constitute their charm. Their subjects are various,
several of them being literary criticisms; the longest, called
“the Art of Poetry,” possesses the greatest value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span></p>

<p>The works of Horace have maintained their popularity in
all ages; his sententious sayings have become aphorisms; and
to-day he is a greater favorite with scholars than ever. Few
classical poets have been so fortunate in their translators.</p>

<p><b>Varius</b> (74-14 B.C.).—Older than Horace or Virgil in the
Augustan galaxy was Varius, the friend who introduced them
both to Mæcenas. An epic on the death of Cæsar, highly
esteemed by his countrymen,—and a tragedy entitled “Thyestes,”
classed with the finest Greek dramas,—have won for
Varius an enviable fame.</p>

<p>Both are lost; but we still have the benefit of the poet’s
labors as the editor of Virgil’s Æneid.</p>

<p><b>Albius Tibullus</b> (59-19 B.C.), another poet of the Augustan
age, perfected the erotic elegy which Catullus had introduced
from Greece. The meagre accounts that remain of his life inform
us that he was a knight, and lost his estates near Rome
for political reasons, after the overthrow of Pompey. These
he partially recovered, it is supposed through the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
Messa’la, a noble of the old school, whose praises he never
tired of sounding. As aide-de-camp, he accompanied Messala
in his expedition against the rebellious Aquitanians, and
doubtless figured in the triumph decreed his victorious friend
by the emperor.</p>

<p>A peaceful life, however, was more in accordance with his
tastes. The hills and dales, the corn-fields, vineyards, and
meadows, possessed greater charms for him than the favor of
Augustus, who vainly sought to attract Tibullus to his court.
Hence we find the poet generally living at his country-seat,
amid rural enjoyments.</p>

<p>The elegies of Tibullus preserve the names of two Roman
beauties—“Delia,” the early mistress of his heart, and “Nem’esis,”
her successor. Delia, “with her queenly charms and
golden locks,” first brought him to her feet, and he wooed her
in his most finished strains. But, like Catullus, he soon found
occasion to lament his fair one’s inconstancy. Delia jilted
him for a richer lover, and Tibullus transferred his affections
to the imperious Nemesis.</p>

<p>The style of Tibullus is sweet and polished. A pensive,
almost melancholy tone pervades his verses. In the following
plaintive elegy, the injured but forgiving poet recalls to
his false one how tenderly he nursed her through a critical
sickness, picturing his dream of happiness with her installed
as the mistress of his rural home, and his rude awakening:—</p>

<p><b>Propertius.</b>—With the name of Tibullus is often linked
that of Propertius, who was born about 50 B.C. at Assisium,
among the Umbrian mountains. In this lovely spot he was
prepared for the study of the law, which he afterward adopted
as his profession at Rome. But Propertius found this calling
distasteful; relinquishing it, accordingly, for the pursuits of
literature, he aspired to be a Roman Callimachus, and grounded
himself in the principles of Alexandrian verse. But too
much study made him artificial, and his numerous mythological
allusions and digressions encumber rather than embellish.
He lacks the sweetness, simplicity, and tenderness, of
Tibullus.</p>

<p>Catullus had his “Lesbia;” Tibullus, his “Delia;” and
Propertius, profiting not by the example of his brother bards,
lavished his affections on the accomplished but fickle “Cynthia,”
who played him false as soon as a rich prætor laid a
fortune at her feet. Cynthia was the single theme of our
poet’s love-lays, all rapture or gentle reproach. In an elegy
to Mæcenas, who had pressed him to attempt an epic, he
sings:—</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You ask me why love-elegy so frequently I follow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And why my little book of tender trifles only sings:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is not from Calliope, nor is it from Apollo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But from my own sweet lady-love my inspiration springs.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If in resplendent purple robe of Cos my darling dresses,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Or if her truant tresses wreathe her forehead with caresses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The tresses of her queenly brow demand her poet’s lays.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another elegy he describes his Cynthia’s charms:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“’Twas not her face, though fair, so smote my eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(Less fair the lily than my love: as snows</div>

  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent2">The choral revels of the Bacchic crew.”</div>

<p><b>Ovid</b> (43 B.C.-17 A.D.).—Publius Ovidius Na’so, the last
of the Augustan poets, was a knight of Sulmo, an ancient
Samnite town in the eastern part of Italy. Designed for the
legal profession, he was sent to Rome to be educated; but
the writing of verses was more congenial than rhetorical
studies; and an eminent critic of the day, on hearing one of
his early declamations, described it as “nothing else than
poetry out of metre.”</p>

<p>After the death of an elder son, his father consented that
Publius should follow the bent of his own inclinations, and
the poet went abroad to study in Greece and travel in Asia
Minor. Returning to Rome, he began his literary career as
the glory of the Augustan age was beginning to fade.</p>

<p>For twenty-two years Ovid wasted his talents on the composition
of licentious love-poems. In the “Loves” (Amo’res),
the earliest of his works, one Corinna is addressed throughout.
The hearty reception with which these loose songs met
at Rome is a sad comment on the degeneracy of the public
taste and morals. They were followed by the “Hero’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>ides,”
a collection of twenty-one imaginary love-letters, inscribed
by the heroines of the past to their absent or unfaithful
lords—an original idea with Ovid. Penelope indicts an
epistle to Ulysses, Medea to Jason, Sappho to Phaon, etc.
In the one last named, translated by Pope, the Lesbian poetess
informs the youth of her resolve to take the Lover’s Leap.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A spring there is, where silver waters show,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clear as a glass, the shining sands below;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A flowery lotus spreads its arms above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shades all the banks, and seems itself a grove:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternal greens the mossy margin grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Watched by the sylvan genius of the place.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here as I lay, and swelled with tears the flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before my sight a watery virgin stood:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She stood and cried, ‘O you that love in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fly hence, and seek the fair Leucadian main!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There stands a rock, from whose impending steep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo’s fane surveys the rolling deep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There injured lovers, leaping from above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their flames extinguish and forget to love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hence, Sappho, haste! from high Leucadia throw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy wretched weight, nor dread the deeps below.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She spoke, and vanished with the voice—I rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And silent tears fall trickling from my eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I go, ye nymphs, those rocks and seas to prove:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And much I fear; but ah! how much I love!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rocks and seas I fly from Phaon’s hate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hope from seas and rocks a milder fate.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the “Art of Love,” Ovid again overleaped the bounds
of propriety, and threw so brilliant a coloring into his pictures
of vice that his readers were fain to linger over them, to enjoy,
and to admire, with manifest danger to their own morals.
When even a daughter of the imperial line was corrupted
by them, Augustus, the professed defender of virtue, felt
that it was time to stop the dissemination of such principles,
and visited the poet with his displeasure. In consequence
of a subsequent and more serious offence, in some way connected
with the royal family, but the nature of which we can
only conjecture, Ovid suddenly received notice to quit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
capital forever, and retire to To’mi, a dreary and desolate
village on the Black Sea, A.D. 9. Despite his urgent prayers,
the decree of banishment was never revoked.</p>

<p>The works of his eight years’ exile are the “Tristia,” or
Sorrows, “Letters from Pontus,” and some shorter poems;
they prove his genius to have been crushed, his spirit broken.
Tomi gave Ovid a grave; even his request to be buried in
Italy was refused.</p>

<p>The best of Ovid’s works were the “Fasti,” or Roman Calendar,
a pleasant almanac in verse, and the “Metamorphoses,”
ingenious in both conception and expression. While engaged
on the Fasti, which he intended to complete in twelve books,
one dedicated to each month, the poet was surprised by the
decree of banishment, and left his work unfinished.</p>

<p>The Metamorphoses, from which modern writers have largely
drawn, gives an account of the transformations of ancient
mythology, such as the changing of Io into a heifer, Daphne
into a laurel, the sisters of Phaëton into the poplars of the Po,
and Atlas into a mountain of stone by the gorgon-head of
Perseus. One of the prettiest of these poems relates to the
metamorphosis of the ivory statue wrought by Pygmalion, into
a living bride, by the goddess of beauty, in answer to the
sculptor’s prayer:—</p>

<p>With the death of Ovid, the flourishing period of poetry terminated.
Among his contemporaries, we may mention, in
passing, the epic poets <span class="smcap">Albinova’nus</span> author of the These’id,
and <span class="smcap">Cornelius Seve’rus</span>, who wrote an heroic on the war
between Augustus and Sextus Pompey. The didactic poets
<span class="smcap">Gratius</span> and <span class="smcap">Manilius</span> also flourished in the Augustan age;
the former memorable for his poem on hunting, the latter for
his “Astronomica.”</p>


<h4>PROSE WRITERS.</h4>


<p><b>Titus Livius.</b>—The last ornament of the Augustan Era is
the historian Livy, born at Pata’vium (now Padua) about 59
B.C.—the scion of a noble line that had figured proudly in the
annals of the Republic. His was the uneventful life of the
scholar, and few particulars of his biography have therefore
been preserved. He appears to have begun his career as a
rhetorician; to have come to the capital about B.C. 31, for
what precise purpose we cannot say, and there to have gained
a ready introduction at court. The emperor, already favorably
impressed with his ability, is said to have placed at his
disposal a suite of rooms in the palace.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as his importunities made the reluctant Virgil the
great epic poet of Rome, so Augustus may have stirred the
ambition of Livy to become its historian; whether he did or
not, we find the rhetorician of Patavium, soon after taking up
his abode at the imperial city, entering upon the composition
of his “Annals,” a work which progressed simultaneously with
the Æneid. As the different decades (divisions of ten books)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
were completed, the author, after first reading them to Augustus
and Mæcenas, published them for the perusal of his countrymen.
They at once made his reputation, and became the
received authority on the national history, raising Livy during
his lifetime, as at the present day, to the rank of the most distinguished
historians. The estimation in which they were
held may be inferred from the story of Pliny—that a citizen
of Cadiz came all the way to Italy merely to see the great
writer the whole Roman world was talking about.</p>

<p>For forty years Livy labored on his history. At the time
of his death, which took place in his native town, 17 A.D., he
had finished 142 books, covering nearly seven and a half centuries
from the founding of Rome. It is supposed that he
intended to add eight more, embracing the entire reign of
Augustus. Only thirty-five of the original books have been
recovered.</p>

<p>The loss of the decades relating to the civil wars is much
to be deplored, and it has ever been the hope of scholars that
some day the missing parts would be found. Several times
has the literary world been thrown into excitement by false
rumors of their discovery. Once, we are told, a learned man
detected in the parchment covering of a battledoor with which
he was playing a page of the favorite historian; but on hastening
to the maker of the toy, to rescue the prized manuscript
to which it had belonged, he found that all had been utilized
in a similar manner. A meagre synopsis of the books that
have perished, serves only to make us regret their loss the
more keenly. (<i>Read Taine’s “Essai sur Tite Live.”</i>)</p>

<p>Livy’s “Annals” is a model of elegant historical writing,
and a repertory of tales and traditions of early heroism, which
have made Roman virtue and prowess the admiration of the
world; yet his statements must be taken with many grains of
allowance. Not that he wilfully misrepresented, but rather
that he trusted too implicitly authorities of doubtful veracity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
and shrunk from the labor of thorough original investigation.
Moreover, a vein of exaggeration runs through his pages. It
was doubtless his intention to be impartial; but carried away
by a natural bias, he was too ready to color or cover over the
blots on his country’s escutcheon. That he stooped not to
curry favor with his superiors is evident from the epithet applied
to him by Augustus—“the Pompeyite”—by reason of
his warm praises of Cæsar’s rival. Ignorance of geography,
military science, and even of the constitutional development
of Rome, is conspicuous in his narrative.</p>

<p>As an artist, however, Livy was great. He excels in depicting
character, whether directly by description, or indirectly
in the actions or utterances of the old Roman worthies.
Hence, artificial as they are and often smelling of the rhetorician’s
lamp, the speeches which Livy puts in the mouths of his
different personages display his genius to advantage. One of
the finest, given below, is that of the old Horatius, pleading
with the people for the life of his son. According to the legend,
in a war between Rome and Alba Longa, it was agreed
by the contending parties, to save unnecessary bloodshed, that
the question at issue should be decided by a hand-to-hand
conflict between three champions on each side,—the brothers
Horatii for Rome, the Curiatii for Alba. All fell save one
Horatius. We leave the conclusion of the story to Livy:—</p>


<p class="center">THE CRIME AND PUNISHMENT OF HORATIUS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Horatius advanced at the head of the Romans, bearing in triumph
the spoils of the three brothers. Near the gate Capena he was met
by his sister, a maiden who had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii;
observing on her brother’s shoulder the military robe of her
lover, made by her own hands, she tore her hair, and with loud and
mournful outcries called on the name of the deceased. His sister’s
lamentations, in the midst of his own triumph and of so great public
joy, irritated the fierce youth to such a degree that, drawing his
sword, he plunged it into her breast, at the same time upbraiding her
in these words: ‘Begone to thy spouse with thy unseasonable love,
since thou couldst forget what is due to the memory of thy deceased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
brothers, to him who still survives, and to thy native country; so
perish every daughter of Rome that shall mourn for its enemy!’</p>

<p>Both the senate and people were shocked at the horrid deed; but
still, in their opinion, his recent merit outweighed its guilt: he was,
however, instantly carried before the king for judgment. The king,
unwilling to take on himself a decision of so melancholy a nature,
summoned an assembly of the people, and then said: ‘I appoint two
commissioners to pass judgment on Horatius for murder, according
to the law.’ The law was of dreadful import: ‘Let two commissioners
pass judgment for murder; if the accused appeal from the commissioners,
let the appeal be tried; if their sentence be confirmed,
cover his head, hang him by a rope on the gallows, let him be scourged
either within the Pomœrium<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> or without the Pomœrium.’</p>

<p>The two commissioners appointed were of opinion that, according
to this law, they were not authorized to acquit him; and, after they
had found him guilty, one of them pronounced judgment in these
words: ‘Publius Horatius, I sentence thee to punishment as a murderer;
go, lictor, bind his hands.’ The lictor had come up to him,
and was fixing the cord, when Horatius, by the advice of Tullus, who
wished to give the mildest interpretation to the law, said, ‘I appeal;’
so the trial on the appeal came before the Commons.</p>

<p>During this trial, the people were very deeply affected, especially
by the behavior of Publius Horatius, the father, who declared that
‘in his judgment his daughter was deservedly put to death; had it
not been so, he would, by his own authority as a father, have inflicted
punishment on his son.’ He then besought them that ‘they
would not leave him childless, whom they had beheld, but a few
hours ago, surrounded by a progeny of uncommon merit.’ Uttering
these words, the old man embraced the youth, and pointing to the
spoils of the Curiatii, which were hung up in the place where now
stands the Horatian column, exclaimed:—</p>

<p>‘O my fellow-citizens! can you bear to behold him laden with
chains, and condemned to ignominy, stripes, and torture, whom but
just now you saw covered with the ornaments of victory, marching
in triumph—a sight so horrid that scarcely could the eyes of the Albans
themselves endure it? Go, lictor, bind the arms which but
now wielded those weapons that acquired dominion to the Roman
people; cover the head of that man to whom your city owes its liberty;
hang him upon the gallows. Scourge him within the Pomœrium;
but do it between those pillars to which are suspended the
trophies of his victory. Scourge him without the Pomœrium; but
do it between the graves of the Curiatii. For to what place can ye
lead this youth, where the monuments of his glory would not redeem
him from the ignominy of such a punishment?”</p>

<p>The people could not withstand either the tears of the father, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
the intrepid spirit of the youth himself, which no kind of danger
could appall; and rather out of admiration of his bravery than regard
to the justice of his cause, they passed a sentence of acquittal.
Wherefore, that some expiation might be made for the act of manifest
murder, the father was ordered to make atonement for his son
at the public expense. After performing expiatory sacrifices, which
continued afterward to be celebrated by the Horatian family, he laid
a beam across the street, and, covering the young man’s head, made
him pass, as it were, under the yoke. The beam remains to this
day, being constantly kept in repair at the expense of the public,
and is called the Sister’s beam. A tomb of squared stone was raised
for Horatia on the spot where she fell.”—<span class="smcap">Baker.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the “Annals of Rome,” Livy also wrote historical
and philosophical dialogues, which we know only by
name. (<i>See Capel’s “Introduction to the Study of Livy.”</i>)</p>

<p><b>Pompeius Trogus</b>, contemporary with Livy, produced a history
of the world, extending from the founding of Nineveh to
the Christian Era. Macedonia fills an important place in this
work, an abridgment of which is still in existence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A prominent rhetorician of the Augustan period was the
elder <span class="smcap">Seneca</span>, of Cordova, in Spain. Portions of his works
(which consist of rhetorical exercises on imaginary cases,
historical events, and circumstances in the lives of great
men, written for the benefit of his sons) have survived; but
nothing remains of a history of Rome ascribed to him.</p>

<p>The orators <span class="smcap">Messala</span> and <span class="smcap">Asinius Pollio</span> graced the early
years of the first emperor’s reign; but, when political eloquence
was interdicted, they retired to private life,—Pollio,
to win new laurels by his tragedies and other literary compositions.
Both were patrons of literature, and loved to gather
round them the eminent poets of their day. Messala’s orations,
known to us only by a few fragments that remain, were
regarded as almost equal to Cicero’s; while Pollio, none of
whose works have been preserved, was ranked by his contemporaries
with Cicero as an orator, with Virgil as a poet, and
with Sallust as an historian.</p>

<h4>NOTES ON EDUCATION, ETC., AMONG THE ROMANS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Education never compulsory, as in Greece. Its chief aim in early times to
make warriors and statesmen. Children usually grounded in the rudiments by
their mother, the father occasionally doing service as a teacher of reading and
writing. From the Greeks, the Romans adopted the custom of employing <i>pædagogi</i>
to instruct their children or accompany them to and from school.</p>

<p>Private schools in Rome about 450 B.C.; Virginia insulted by Appius Claudius,
while on her way to school. The youth instructed at these institutions in
reading, writing, and arithmetic, and required to memorize the laws of the Twelve
Tables. Grammar was next essayed; and a course in rhetoric and oratory completed
the Roman boy’s education. Many continued their studies at Athens,
Rhodes, or Alexandria.</p>

<p>The teachers often provincials or freedmen. In the golden age, Greek tutors
very generally the companions and flatterers of the wealthy Romans. During
the reign of Augustus, great schools at Cordova and Marseilles rivalled the
academy of Flaccus at Rome, the favorite of the emperor, who paid Flaccus a
salary of $3,600, and offered special inducements in the way of prizes to such as
would join his school. Under Vespasian the first Roman college, the Athenæum,
was established; botany, zoölogy, and mineralogy, now became favorite studies.</p>

<p>Rome had its booksellers in the golden age, to supply the demand for standard
authors and school manuals. Books multiplied rapidly by transcription, and
were cheap in proportion. At the beginning of the first century B.C., many
private libraries in Rome; every noble took pride in his collection of manuscripts.
First public library founded by Asinius Pollio, whose example was
followed by others. (<i>Consult Gove’s “Companion to School Classics.”</i>)</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
<p>Earliest known attempts at journalism, 59 B.C. The <i>Acta</i> of the senate and
of the people, the first publications. The latter, a daily (<i>diurna</i>, whence <i>journal</i>),
had an extensive circulation throughout the Roman territories. Stenography
practised at this time by the Romans, and subsequently taught in their
schools. A freedman of Cicero said to have invented the system of short-hand.
Sympathetic ink in use for writing love-letters and secret correspondence. For
this purpose Ovid recommends milk, which may be made visible by dusting powdered
charcoal on the letters. To keep mice from gnawing their papyrus and
parchment rolls, some Roman writers mixed wormwood with their inks.</p>

<small><i>AGE OF DECLINE.</i></small></h3></div>


<p><b>Silver Age of Roman Letters.</b>—With the death of Augustus
and the accession of his step-son Tiberius, despotism in its
worst form was established at Rome, and, as in Greece, a decline
of letters immediately followed. Symptoms of literary
decay had already shown themselves in the reign of the first
emperor, although he took care to conceal his assumption of
absolute power under the mask of republican forms, and was
known to all as a patron of learning. Tiberius, on the contrary,
openly declared himself the enemy of freedom, both
political and intellectual; and when, in 37 A.D., his attendants,
no longer able to endure his rule of blood, smothered
the monster with pillows, Latin literature was at its lowest ebb.</p>

<p>A brief renaissance, however, succeeded; so that the imperial
fiend Nero was able to number among his victims an epic
poet, Lucan, and a philosopher and dramatist of no common
stamp, Seneca. Under the Cæsars, genius was hopelessly
fettered; a chance word might condemn its author to the
headsman; the poet, the historian, the orator, must needs
suppress his sentiments or forfeit his self-respect by flattering
the reigning despot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span></p>

<p>A brighter day dawned with the mild rule of Nerva, Trajan,
Hadrian, and the Antonines (96-180 A.D.). During this
golden age of the Roman empire, poetry for a time recovered
its vitality, and through the stinging satires of Juvenal
denounced the abuses that had prevailed in the days of Nero
and Domitian; while in the histories of Tacitus, prose indignantly
broke its enforced silence, and held up to public detestation
the despots of the past. But this revival was short-lived.
Latin literature rapidly degenerated, for Latin genius
was no more. In the later centuries of the empire, science
and jurisprudence alone flourished on the soil where poetry
had now ceased to bloom. (<i>Refer to Nisard’s “Études sur les
Poètes Latins de la Décadence”</i>)</p>


<h4>ERA OF THE CÆSARS (14-96 A.D.).</h4>

<p>In the reign of Tiberius, we meet with the names of Velleius
Paterculus, the court historian, Celsus, and Phædrus.</p>


<p><b>Velleius Paterculus</b> is memorable for his epitome of Roman
history, a work in other respects meritorious, but marred
by its author’s servile praise of Tiberius. Yet we must remember
that Velleius was not permitted to see the worst
phase of this emperor’s tyranny. When the treachery of the
prime minister Seja’nus was exposed, the historian, though
not implicated with him, was one of the first to be put to
death. He was thus prevented from witnessing the murders
of hundreds of other innocent persons—atrocities that might
have altered his estimate of his ungrateful master.</p>


<p><b>Valerius Maximus</b>, his contemporary and fellow-flatterer,
prepared a cyclopædia of anecdotes gleaned from the history
of Rome and foreign countries, entitled “Remarkable Deeds
and Sayings.” It was designed for the use of persons who
had not the time or inclination to make original investigations,
and, though written in an artificial style, contains much
that is interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span></p>


<p><b>Celsus</b> was the author of a scientific encyclopædia, whose
twenty books were devoted to farming, medicine, rhetoric,
jurisprudence, and military tactics. The eight books on medicine
still survive, constituting the great Roman authority on
that subject.</p>

<p>Before his day the art of medicine and surgery had been
almost entirely confined to Greek physicians; but Celsus
dignified it as a calling worthy of Romans, not only practising
with success among his countrymen, but committing to
writing the results of his experience. He was the first ancient
author who recommended the tying of blood-vessels for
the purpose of checking hemorrhage.</p>


<p><b>Phædrus</b>, the only noteworthy poet of Tiberius’s reign, is
known to us by his fables. Of his life, we have few facts. He
is supposed to have been brought from Thrace to Rome, as a
captive; and to have lived there as the slave of Augustus,
who, recognizing his latent talent, gave him an education and
finally his freedom.</p>

<p>In the sunshine of his patron’s smiles, Phædrus led a happy
life; but on the death of Augustus he was exposed to the
persecutions of Sejanus, who virtually controlled the state
under the succeeding emperor, and who affected to see in the
poet’s fables masked attacks upon his own vicious career.
Phædrus, however, outlived all his enemies, and died at a
good old age.</p>

<p>The fables of Phædrus, preserved in a single manuscript,
were discovered in an abbey at Rheims (1561), and, after
narrowly escaping destruction at the hands of some French
fanatics, were published to the world. In the main translated
or imitated from Æsop, whom their author thus made
known to the Romans, they commend themselves for their
conciseness and simplicity, as well as for the moral lessons
they convey. His “pleasant tales” may be judged of by the
following specimens:—</p>

<p>The three great ornaments of Nero’s reign (54-68 A.D.)
were Persius the satirist, Seneca, and his nephew Lucan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>


<p><b>Persius.</b>—Born at the Etruscan town of Volaterræ (34 A.D.),
Persius was brought to Rome by his mother at the age of
twelve, and there educated. In the Stoic, Cornu’tus, he found
his ideal preceptor, and to this “best of friends” the poet
pays a beautiful tribute in the following verses, among the
finest he ever wrote:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“When first I laid the purple<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> by, and free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet trembling at my new-felt liberty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approached the hearth, and on the Lares hung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bulla, from my willing neck unstrung;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When gay associates, sporting at my side,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">One time of study and of rest we knew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One frugal board where, every care resigned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An hour of blameless mirth relaxed the mind.”—<span class="smcap">Gifford.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Death overtook our poet in his 28th year (62 A.D.). All
we have of his writings is six satires—only 650 hexameter
lines. After his death these were published, and elicited unbounded
admiration. Other works of his were torn up by his
mother, who deemed them unworthy of his genius. Persius
bequeathed to Cornutus his library of 700 manuscripts.</p>

<p>The satires of Persius were written in the interest of morality,
and what gave them weight was that all knew their author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
to be a man who practised the virtue he commended, a man
of stainless character in an age of universal licentiousness.
And yet we do not find him lashing vice as we should expect.
Was he loath to do so, lest the very pictures he must draw
might corrupt? Or, was Persius forced to hold his peace in
the presence of a despot who revelled in the vilest excesses,
whose policy it was to reduce his subjects to his own low
level? Perhaps for both reasons he preferred to assail wickedness
in the abstract. Certainly his “maidenly modesty”
shrunk from portraying the hideous sins that flaunted around
him, while his philosophical tenets inclined him to keep aloof
from the world. (<i>Read Nettleship’s “The Roman Satura.”</i>)</p>

<p>Poetasters and pedants that pandered to the perverted
taste of the day, received the brunt of his attack in his First
Satire. The Second discusses the proper subjects of prayer.
How few, says the poet, would be willing to have their petitions
made public:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Hard, hard the task, from the low muttered prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To free the fanes; or find one suppliant there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who dares to ask but what his state requires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And live to heaven and earth with known desires!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sound sense, integrity, a conscience clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are begged aloud, that all at hand may hear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But prayers like these (half whispered, half suppressed)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tongue scarce hazards from the conscious breast:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘O that I could my rich old uncle see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In funeral pomp!’—’ O that some deity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pots of buried gold would guide my share!’—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘O that my ward, whom I succeed as heir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were once at rest! poor child, he lives in pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death to him must be accounted gain.’—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘By wedlock thrice has Nerius swelled his store,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now—is he a widower once more!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Second Satire concludes with these noble lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“No; let me bring the immortal gods a mind,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A bosom dyed in honor’s noblest grain,</div>

<p><b>Lucius Annæus Seneca</b>, son of the rhetorician, was born at
Cordova B.C. 7, but received his education at Rome under
the supervision of his father. From the first he displayed
great interest in his studies, and as he grew in years he indulged
his natural bent for philosophical researches. So
thorough a Pythagorean did he become that he even eschewed
animal food, lest he should devour flesh that had
once been animated by a human soul. On the remonstrance
of his parent, however, he renounced vegetarianism and “lived
as others lived” again. At a later period we find him the
leader of the Stoics at Rome.</p>

<p>Seneca early made his mark as an orator. Hearing him
plead eloquently on one occasion in the senate, Caligula, out
of jealousy, threatened to have him executed, and was deterred
only by the consideration that Seneca had the consumption
and was not likely to live for any length of time.</p>

<p>But Seneca survived this imperial butcher, to become the
instructor and moral guide of the youthful Nero. While
Nero submitted to his counsels, Rome enjoyed a halcyon age,
long remembered by her people as <i>the Five Years</i>. His influence
led to the adoption of many salutary measures; it is
thought to have been at his instigation that Nero despatched
an expedition to explore the sources of the Nile—the first recorded
in history. Well would it have been for Rome, had
Nero continued to follow the advice of Seneca.</p>

<p>This, however, was not to be; a sudden change took place
in the disposition of the prince, when his mother was charged
with conspiring against him. It was her life or his; and
Nero won. The taste of blood transformed him into a monster,
and he forthwith entered upon a reign of horrors that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
has no equal in history. Virtue was now the surest road to
ruin. Falsely accused of complicity in a conspiracy, Seneca
was sentenced to put an end to his own life (65 A.D.). With
perfect calmness he received the royal mandate, and caused
his veins to be severed; but the blood flowing too slowly, he
entered a vapor-bath and ended his sufferings by suffocation.
His wife Paulina elected to die with him, and in the same
manner; but Nero had her veins ligatured, and thus added
several years of misery to her life. To his friends, Seneca
was permitted to leave no more valuable legacy than his virtuous
example.</p>

<p>Seneca was a great moral leader, the first of a class of philosophers
who aimed at winning the people back to the virtue
of primitive Rome. His teachings were in strange contrast
to the age in which he lived; they bear a striking resemblance
to those of the Gospel, with which he may have
become acquainted through St. Paul. The fathers of the
Church were loud in their praises of “the divine pagan,”
but there is no evidence that, as some have stated, Seneca
was persuaded by the apostle to become a Christian.</p>

<p>Our philosopher is described as simple in his tastes.
Though the envied possessor of a princely fortune, he could
consistently write in support of temperance on his table of
gold. A cupful of water from the brook was sweeter to him
than beakers of Italy’s choicest wines, and the fruits of the
wild wood he preferred to the luxurious dishes fashion required
him to spread before the rich and great. His fault
was weakness, which betrayed him into flattery, and perhaps
made him an unwilling accessory to some of his master’s
crimes.</p>

<p>Seneca was the author, not only of philosophical treatises,
but also of ten tragedies, and one hundred and twenty-four
moral epistles. He even attempted a satire on the stupidity
of the emperor Claudius, representing him as transformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
after death, not into a god, as the senate decreed, but into a
pumpkin. Several other works from his pen are lost.</p>

<p>The best of Seneca’s treatises are those on Anger, Providence,
and Consolation. His style, labored, antithetical, and
full of repetitions, has an artificial glitter about it that impresses
the reader unfavorably.</p>

<p>“How idle are many of those things that make us stark mad! A
resty horse, the overturning of a glass, the falling of a key, the dragging
of a chair, a jealousy, a misconstruction. How shall that man
endure the extremities of hunger and thirst, that flies into a rage only
for the putting of a little too much water in his wine? What haste
is there to lay a servant by the heels, or break a leg or an arm immediately
for it? The answer of a servant, a wife, a tenant, puts some
people out of all patience, and yet they can quarrel with the government
for not allowing them the same liberty in public which they
themselves deny to their own families. If they say nothing, ’tis contumacy;
if they speak or laugh, ’tis insolence. Neither are our eyes
less curious and fantastical than our ears. When we are abroad, we
can bear well enough with foul ways, nasty streets, noisome ditches;
but a spot upon a dish at home, or an unswept hearth, absolutely
distracts us. And what’s the reason, but that we are patient in the
one place and peevish in the other?</p>

<p>Nothing makes us more intemperate than luxury. When we are
once weakened with our pleasures, everything grows intolerable.
And we are angry as well with those things that cannot hurt us as
with those that do. We tear a book because it is blotted; and our
clothes because they are not well made—things that neither deserve
our anger nor feel it. The tailor perchance did his best, or had no
intent to displease us. If so, first, why should we be angry at all?
Secondly, why should we be angry with the thing for the man’s
sake? Nay, our anger extends even to dogs, horses, and other beasts.</p>

<p>Cyrus, in his design upon Babylon, found a river in his way that
put a stop to his march. The current was strong, and carried away
one of the horses that belonged to his own chariot; upon this he swore
that, since it had obstructed his passage, it should never hinder that
of another, and presently set his whole army to work on it, which
diverted it into a hundred and fourscore channels, and laid it dry.
In this ignoble and unprofitable employment he lost his time and the
soldiers their courage; moreover, he gave his adversaries an opportunity
of providing themselves, while he was waging war with a
river instead of an enemy.”</p>

<p><b>Lucan</b> (39-65 A.D.), the nephew of Seneca, though born at
Cordova, was brought up at Rome, and there became the fellow-pupil
and favorite companion of Nero. But the superior
genius of the Spanish youth provoked the jealousy of his royal
master, who had rather too high an opinion of his own attainments,
and was nettled by the public verdict that Lucan, then
only twenty-three years of age, was the greatest of living poets.
At length the awarding of the prize to Lucan in a literary
contest between them so enraged the emperor that he forbade
his former friend to recite any more pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span></p>

<p>Lucan’s indiscretion sealed his fate. Not content with libellous
attacks upon Nero, he became implicated in a conspiracy
against the government, upon the detection of which
he was condemned to death. Nero allowing him to choose
the manner in which he should suffer, the poet had his veins
opened in a hot bath. Becoming faint from loss of blood, he
recited a passage from his own “Pharsalia,” descriptive of the
death of a snake-bitten soldier:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So the warm blood at once from every part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ran purple poison down, and drained the fainting heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blood falls for tears, and o’er his mournful face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ruddy drops their tainted passage trace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’er the liquid juices find a way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There streams of blood, there crimson rivers stray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His mouth and gushing nostrils pour a flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And e’en the pores ooze out the trickling blood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the red deluge all the parts lie drowned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the whole body seems one bleeding wound”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">and so he passed away.</p>

<p>Lucan was interred at Rome in his own garden. An ancient
monument in the church of Santo Paulo contains an
inscription to his memory, probably placed there by order of
Nero, who seems after all to have rendered secret homage to
his genius and virtue. The talents of his wife have been
highly commended; and it is probable that she assisted him
in composing his work.</p>

<p>The epic “Pharsalia” is the only poem of Lucan’s that we
now possess. Its subject is the civil war between Cæsar and
Pompey; and it receives its name from the place at which
the decisive battle between the rival commanders was fought.
Though inferior to the Æneid, it certainly displays talent of a
high order. Critics have differed in their estimate of Lucan.
That he has faults, none will deny who are familiar with his
tumid style and love of tinsel. On the other hand, energy,
exuberant imagination, and a fervent love of liberty, are his
peculiar excellences. The defects of the Pharsalia are excus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>able
in a youth of twenty-six. Had the author lived to revise
and finish the work, it might have equalled Virgil’s epic.</p>

<p>Lucan is partial to the supernatural; dreams, witches, and
ghosts, enter freely into his machinery. In the sixth book of
the Pharsalia, he makes Pompey’s son consult the witch Erichtho
on the eve of the battle. His picture of the weird woman
is quoted here as one of the most imaginative passages in the
whole range of classical poetry. Erichtho is the type of a
class of impostors firmly believed in by the Romans of that
day; the powers with which the poet endows her are simply
those attributed to her by popular superstition.</p>

<p>The Flavian Era is memorable for a few writers of note.
Pliny the Elder, called also the Naturalist, was an intimate
friend of the emperor Vespasian; while the names of Martial,
Statius, and Quintilian, are associated with the reign of Domitian,
Vespasian’s son (81-96 A.D.).</p>


<p><b>Pliny the Elder</b> (23-79 A.D.) was born at Como in Cisalpine
Gaul, and there passed his boyhood. We find him
afterward at Rome attending rhetorical lectures, and still
later in his career serving as a soldier in Germany. Nero
made him proconsul of Spain, and at the expiration of his
term he returned to Rome to find his old friend Vespasian
invested with the purple.</p>

<p>Pliny had already become distinguished as the author of a
treatise on “the Use of the Javelin,” a “History of the German
Wars,” and eight books on “Difficulties in the Latin
Language.” He now devoted himself to the compilation of
his “Natural History,” the only work we have left from his
pen, which Cuvier pronounced “one of the most precious
monuments that have come down to us from ancient times.”</p>

<p>We might well wonder how, in the face of his onerous public
duties, Pliny found time for literary pursuits so engrossing,
did not his nephew, Pliny the Younger, describe to us his
wonderful industry. His day’s work began at 1 or 2 A.M.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
even in winter; sometimes at midnight. Before sunrise he
repaired to the palace to chat informally with Vespasian, who
like him was accustomed to rob the night of a few hours;
after which he applied himself to business and study, devoting
every spare moment to the accumulation of knowledge.
“No book so bad but that something good may be gleaned
from it,” was his motto. To be without a volume and a portable
writing-desk was a crime in Pliny’s eyes. A slave constantly
attended him, to take down his words in short-hand;
during his meals he employed a reader, and even in his
bath he dictated or listened. “I remember his chiding
me,” said his nephew, “for taking a walk, saying ‘You might
have saved three hours.’ Compared with him, I am an idle
vagabond.”</p>

<p>Pliny the Elder was a martyr to science. In August, 79
A.D., while in command of the Mediterranean squadron, to
which he had been appointed by Vespasian, word was brought
him that Vesuvius was in a state of eruption. Desiring to investigate
the phenomenon, he steered straight for the blazing
mountain, pushed on through the rain of hot ashes and pumice-stones,
and when advised by the pilot to turn back fearlessly
replied, “Fortune favors the brave!” He effected a
landing, but only to be suffocated by the sulphurous vapors
that proved fatal to so many of the inhabitants of Herculaneum
and Pompeii.</p>

<p>Pliny was the master-compiler of antiquity; and he was
only a compiler, as he himself acknowledged. His Natural
History, in thirty-seven books, is a storehouse of quaint lore,
according to its author a condensation of two thousand volumes,
relating to astronomy, geography, zoölogy, botany, mineralogy,
diseases and their remedies, etc. A penchant for the
marvellous, which shows him to have been a man of infinite
credulity, was a weakness of Pliny; yet his stories were implicitly
trusted in the Dark Ages, and many of them re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>appeared
in the tales of the Arabian Nights. A few of his
curious statements are subjoined:—</p>


<p class="center">ECCENTRICITIES OF NATURE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some individuals are born with certain parts of the body endowed
with properties of a marvellous nature. Such was the case
with King Pyrrhus, the great toe of whose right foot cured diseases
of the spleen merely by touching the patient. We are also informed
that this toe could not be reduced to ashes together with the other
portions of the body.</p>

<p>India and Ethiopia abound in wonders. According to Megasthenes,
on a mountain called Nulo there dwells a race of men who have
their feet turned backward, with eight toes on each foot. On many
of the mountains, again, there is a tribe of men who have the heads
of dogs; instead of speaking they bark, and, furnished with claws,
they live by hunting and catching birds. According to Ctesias, the
number of this people is more than 120,000. This author speaks also
of another race of men called Single-legs, who have only one limb,
but are able to leap with surprising agility. The same people are
also called Foot-shadowers, because they are in the habit of lying on
their backs, and protecting themselves from the sun by the shade of
their feet.</p>

<p>At the very extremity of India, near the source of the river Ganges,
there is the nation of Mouthless people; their bodies are rough and
overgrown with hair, and they cover themselves with a down plucked
from the leaves of trees. These people subsist only by breathing and
by the odors which they inhale through the nostrils. They support
themselves upon neither meat nor drink; when they go upon a long
journey, they carry with them only odoriferous roots and flowers,
and wild apples, that they may not be without something to smell
at. But an odor which is a little more powerful than usual easily
destroys them.”</p>
</div>


<p class="center">HYDROPHOBIA.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Canine madness is fatal to man during the heat of the Dog-star,
and proves so in consequence of those who are bitten having a deadly
horror of water. For this reason, during the thirty days that the
star exerts its influence, we try to prevent the disease in dogs; or,
if they are attacked by it, give them hellebore.</p>

<p>We have a single remedy against the bite, which has been but
lately discovered—the root of the wild rose, which is called dog-rose.
Columella informs us that if, on the fortieth day after the
birth of a pup, the last bone of the tail is bitten off, the sinew will
follow with it; after which the tail will not grow, and the dog will
never become rabid.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span></p>


<p class="center">REMEDIES FOR TOOTHACHE, ETC.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Toothache is alleviated by scarifying the gums with bones of
the sea-dragon, or by rubbing the teeth once a year with the brains
of a dog-fish boiled in oil. It is a very good plan, too, for the cure
of toothache, to lance the gums with the sting of the ray. This
sting is pounded and applied to the teeth with white hellebore, having
the effect of extracting them without the slightest difficulty. A
decoction is made of a single frog boiled in two-thirds of a pint of
vinegar, and the teeth are rinsed with it. It is generally thought
that this recipe applies more particularly to the double teeth, and
that the vinegar prepared as above mentioned is remarkably useful
for strengthening them when loose. Ashes, also, of burnt crabs make
an excellent dentifrice.</p>

<p>There is a small frog which ascends trees, and croaks aloud there;
if a person suffering from cough spits into its mouth and then lets it
go, he will experience a cure. For cough attended with spitting of
blood, it is recommended to beat up the raw flesh of a snail, and to
drink it in hot water.”—<span class="smcap">Riley.</span></p>
</div>


<p><b>Martial</b> (43-117 A.D.).—The chief poet of Domitian’s
reign was Martial, master of the Latin epigram. Born in
Spain, Martial came to Rome in Nero’s time and began the
study of law. But finding it uncongenial, he adopted literature
as a profession, and rose to distinction under Titus and
Domitian, his sordid flattery of the latter securing him wealth
and honors.</p>

<p>The epigrams of Martial are pithy, pointed with satire, and
not without elegance; but the pleasure of reading them is
constantly interrupted by coarse allusions and even downright
obscenity. Hence it has been justly said that Martial
taught vice while reproving it. His poems, however, contain
valuable pictures of Roman manners.</p>

<p><b>Statius</b> (61-96 A.D.), a contemporary and rival of Martial,
was the author of the epic “Theba’is,” based on the strife of
the sons of Œdipus (see p. 200). Despite the fact that the
poet gave a year’s work to each of its twelve books, this epic
has little to recommend it.</p>

<p>Statius began another poem on the life of Achilles, which
he did not live to finish. His forte lay not in the line of epics,
but in the improvising of short pointed pieces, thirty-two of
which are preserved in the collection called “Silvæ.” Juvenal
bears witness to his popularity.</p>

<p>Statius was patronized by the emperor Domitian, but is said
to have been stabbed by the latter with a stylus, in a fit of
anger. The following tender lines are from a poem addressed

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p><b>Quintilian</b> (35-95 A.D.), of Spanish parentage but Roman
education, for many years taught eloquence successfully in the
capital, numbering among his pupils the nephews of Domitian.
He had the good fortune to enjoy the favor of the emperor,
and filled a professorship to which was attached an annual
salary of about $4,000.</p>

<p>Quintilian is honored as the author of the “Institutes of
Oratory,” an exhaustive rhetorical treatise in twelve books,
devoted to the education of the orator from infancy. “No
other author,” it has been said, “ever adorned a scientific
treatise with so many happy metaphors.” No other author,
it may be added, ever succeeded better in investing a dry
subject with general interest. The “Institutes” may be read
with profit by all who desire to improve their style.</p>

<p>Quintilian insists on virtue as a requisite of the perfect
orator; yet with strange inconsistency excuses a falsehood
if told in a good cause, and justifies the doing of evil that
good may come. We present a few paragraphs on</p>


<p class="center">THE EMBELLISHMENT OF STYLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By polish and embellishment of style the orator recommends
himself to his auditors in his proper character; in his other efforts
he courts the approbation of the learned, in this the applause of the
multitude. Cicero, in pleading the cause of Cornelius, fought with
arms that were not only stout, but dazzling; nor would he, merely
by instructing the judge, or by speaking to the purpose in pure Latin
and with perspicuity, have caused the Roman people to testify their
admiration of him not only by acclamations, but even by tumults of
applause. It was the sublimity, magnificence, splendor, and dignity
of his eloquence, that drew forth that thunder of approbation.</p>

<p>This grace of style may contribute in no small degree to the success
of a cause; for those who listen with pleasure are both more
attentive and more ready to believe; they are very frequently captivated
with pleasure, and sometimes hurried away in admiration.
Thus the glitter of a sword strikes something of terror into the eyes;
and thunderstorms themselves would not alarm us so much as they
do, if it were their force only, and not also their flame, that was
dreaded. Cicero, accordingly, in one of his letters to Brutus, makes
with good reason the following remark: ‘That eloquence which ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>cites
no admiration, I account as nothing.’ Aristotle, also, thinks
that to excite admiration should be one of our greatest objects.</p>

<p>But let the embellishment of our style be manly, noble, and chaste;
let it not affect effeminate delicacy, or a complexion counterfeited by
paint, but let it glow with genuine health and vigor. Should I think
a piece of land better cultivated, in which the owner should show me
lilies, anemonies, and violets, and fountains playing, than one in which
there is a plentiful harvest, or vines laden with grapes? Should I
prefer barren plane-trees, or clipped myrtles, to elms embraced with
vines, and fruitful olive-trees? The rich may have such unproductive
gratifications; but what would they be, if they had nothing
else?</p>

<p>Whatever may be attractive in conception, elegant in expression,
pleasing in figures, rich in metaphor, or polished in composition, the
orator, like a dealer, as it were, in eloquence, will lay before his audience
for them to inspect, and almost to handle; for his success entirely
concerns his reputation, and not his cause. But when a serious
affair is in question, and there is a contest in real earnest, anxiety for
mere applause should be an orator’s last concern. Indeed, no speaker,
where important interests are involved, should be very solicitous
about his words.”—<span class="smcap">Watson.</span></p>

<h4>AGE OF TRAJAN AND THE ANTONINES.</h4>


<p><b>Juvenal</b> (40-125 A.D.), the single poet of this age, ranks
with Rome’s great writers. The accounts of his life are fragmentary
and obscure. A native of Aqui’num in Latium, he
came to Rome, and was apparently a student of rhetoric, perhaps
an advocate. A chance lampoon on an actor revealed
to him his satirical talent, and forthwith he applied himself to
that branch of poetry in which he became so eminent. Too
modest at first to read his satires even before his friends, Juvenal
postponed publishing them until his sixtieth year, when
they took Rome by storm. Sixteen of them survive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span></p>

<p>His fierce diatribes not unnaturally gave offence in high
places; and at length the emperor Ha’drian<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> quietly sent
their author off to Egypt, to command a Roman cohort stationed there—a
disgrace which brought the old satirist in sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>Juvenal probed Roman society to its very depths, laying
bare vices of the blackest dye. In his day, the degenerate
masters of the world even out-sodomed Sodom in depravity.
Nobles and emperors openly perpetrated the vilest crimes.
High-born ladies, in male attire, entered the arena to fight like
gladiators; revelled in reckless extravagance; plunged into
immoralities that call up a blush in the very recital, and even
added the arts of the poisoner to their accomplishments. Thus
the poet exclaims against these fashionable murderesses:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They see upon the stage the Grecian wife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Redeeming with her own her husband’s life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, in her place, would willingly deprive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their lords of breath, to keep their dogs alive!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Abroad, at home, the Belides<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> you meet,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But here the difference lies—those bungling wives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a blunt axe hacked out their husbands’ lives;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While now the deed is done with dexterous art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a drugged bowl performs the axe’s part.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span></p>
<p>In the blaze of his satire Juvenal brought out the representative
characters of his time. Parasites, hypocrites, and panders,
upstarts, legacy-hunters, and gamblers, ballet-dancers
and fortune-tellers, gluttons and sots,—defile before us in his
pages till we turn with nausea from the revolting panorama.
Well might the poet sigh:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! happy were our sires, estranged from crimes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And happy, happy were the good old times,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which saw beneath their kings’, their tribunes’ reign,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One cell the nation’s criminals contain!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Juvenal’s vividness of description and minuteness of detail
show him to have been personally familiar with the vices he
lashed; that he kept himself unspotted we can neither assert
nor deny. His satires are full of moral precepts and virtuous
sentiments; the Tenth, perhaps the gem of the collection, has
lent more thoughts and expressions to modern times than any
other Latin poem of equal length. It closes with a beautiful
petition:—</p>


<p class="center">JUVENAL’S PRAYER.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And look undaunted on a future state;</div>

<p>Brevity, intensity, and vigor, are conspicuous elements in
our author’s style. He always used “the best words in the
right places.” Said Dryden, his only peer in satiric poetry,
“Juvenal gives me as much pleasure as I can bear.” We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>

<p><b>Tacitus</b> (54-118 A.D.).—Foremost among the prose writers
of this later period was Caius Cornelius Tacitus, by some considered
the greatest of Roman historians. Of his early life
we know nothing, though as a youth he seems to have mastered
those arts which afterward made him a successful orator.
In the reign of Vespasian he took to wife the daughter
of Julius Agricola, the Roman governor of Britain, and began
a public career which culminated under Nerva (97 A.D.) in
the consulship. After this he probably confined his attention
to literature, busying himself with the compilation of historical
works until death put an end to his labors.</p>

<p>The first of these in the order of time was the “Agricola,”
an admirable biography of the author’s father-in-law, “the
hero of a hundred fights, the conqueror of those warlike islanders
whom the mighty Julius left to their original freedom,
and whom Claudius and his captains imperfectly subdued.”
It is particularly valuable for the light it casts on the history
of Britain, and the influence of Roman institutions.</p>

<p>“Agricola,” said Tacitus, “gave private encouragement
and public aid to the building of temples, courts of justice,
and dwelling-houses, praising the energetic and reproving the
indolent. Thus an honorable rivalry took the place of compulsion.
He likewise provided a liberal education for the
sons of the chiefs, and showed such a preference for the natural
powers of the Britons over the industry of the Gauls that
they who lately disdained the tongue of Rome now coveted
its eloquence. Hence, too, a liking sprung up for our style
of dress, and the <i>toga</i> became fashionable. Step by step they
were led to things which dispose to vice—the lounge, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
bath, the elegant banquet. All this, in their ignorance, they
called civilization.”</p>

<p>The “Agricola” was followed by “the Germania,” a treatise on
the situation, customs, and tribes of Germany, in whose
freedom-loving warriors Tacitus saw an enemy to be feared.
What more caustic satires than his telling contrasts of their
simple habits with Roman luxury, their stern morality with
Roman profligacy? The Germania may be regarded as a
warning from a patriotic historian to his vice-ridden, enervated
countrymen—a warning which they would have done well to
regard. Particularly pleasing are its picturesque sketches of
German life, written in concise, vigorous language.</p>

<p>The remaining works of Tacitus are his “Histories,” “Annals,” and
a Dialogue on “the Decline of Eloquence.” The
Histories covered the reigns of the Roman emperors from
Galba to Domitian inclusive (69-96 A.D.); about one-third
of the work is preserved. The genius of Tacitus did ample
justice to the tremendous issues of this eventful period, described
by him as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am entering on the history of a period rich in disasters, frightful
in its wars, torn by civil strife, and even in peace full of horrors.
Four emperors perished by the sword. There were three civil wars:
there were more with foreign enemies: there were often wars that
had both characters at once. Now, too, Italy was prostrated by disasters,
either entirely novel or that recurred only after a long succession
of ages. Cities in Campania’s richest plains were swallowed
up and overwhelmed; Rome was wasted by conflagrations, its oldest temples
were consumed, and the Capitol itself was fired by the
hands of citizens. Never, surely, did more terrible calamities of the
Roman people, or evidence more conclusive, prove that the gods take
no thought for our happiness, but only for our punishment.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the “Annals” (sixteen books), which traced the history
of the emperors from the death of Augustus up to the point
at which the Histories had opened, the voice of the indignant
satirist is everywhere heard. Portions of this work, which
were published about 115 A.D., are lost. We extract the
historian’s vivid description of the burning of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span></p>


<p class="center">THE BURNING OF ROME.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There followed a dreadful disaster, whether fortuitously or by
the wicked contrivance of the prince is not determined, for both
are asserted by historians. But of all the calamities which ever befell
this city from the rage of fire, this was the most terrible. It
broke out in that part of the Circus which is contiguous to mounts
Palatine and Cœlius, where, by reason of shops in which were kept
such goods as minister aliment to fire, the moment it commenced it
acquired strength, and being accelerated by the wind, it spread at
once through the whole extent of the Circus. For neither were the
houses secured by enclosures, nor the temples environed with walls,
nor was there any other obstacle to intercept its progress; but the
flame, spreading every way impetuously, invaded first the lower regions
of the city, then mounted to the higher; then again ravaging
the lower, it baffled every effort to extinguish it, by the rapidity of its
destructive course, and from the liability of the city to conflagration
in consequence of the narrow and intricate alleys, and the irregularity
of the streets in ancient Rome.</p>

<p>Add to this the wailings of terrified women, the infirm condition
of the aged, and the helplessness of childhood; such as strove to
provide for themselves, and those who labored to assist others;
these dragging the feeble, those waiting for them; some hurrying,
others lingering; altogether created a scene of universal confusion
and embarrassment. While they looked back upon the danger in
their rear, they often found themselves beset before, and on their
sides; or if they had escaped into the quarters adjoining, these too
were already seized by the devouring flames; even the parts which
they believed to be remote and exempt, were found to be in the
same distress.</p>

<p>At last, not knowing what to shun or where to seek sanctuary,
they crowded the streets, and lay along in the open fields. Some,
from the loss of their whole substance, even the means of their daily
sustenance, others, from affection for their relatives whom they had
not been able to snatch from the flames, suffered themselves to perish
in them, though they had opportunity to escape. Neither dared
any man offer to check the fire: so repeated were the menaces of
many who forbade to extinguish it; and because others openly threw
fire-brands, with loud declarations ‘that they had one who authorized
them;’ whether they did it that they might plunder with less
restraint, or in consequence of orders given.</p>

<p>Nero, who was at that juncture sojourning at Antium, did not return
to the city till the fire approached that quarter of his house
which connected the palace with the gardens of Mæcenas; nor could
it, however, be prevented from devouring the house, and palace, and
everything around. But for the relief of the people thus destitute
and driven from their dwellings, he opened the field of Mars, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
even his own gardens. He likewise reared temporary houses for
the reception of the forlorn multitude; from Ostia and the neighboring
cities were brought household necessaries, and the price of
grain was reduced to three sesterces (about 11½ cts.) the measure.
All which proceedings, though of a popular character, were thrown
away, because a rumor had become universally current, that at the
very time when the city was in flames Nero, going on the stage of
his private theatre, sung ‘The Destruction of Troy,’ assimilating
the present disaster to that catastrophe of ancient times.</p>

<p>At length, on the sixth day, the conflagration was stayed by pulling
down an immense quantity of buildings, so that an open space
and, as it were, void air, might check the raging element by breaking
the continuity.... But not all the bounties that the prince
could bestow, nor all the atonements which could be presented to
the gods, availed to relieve Nero from the infamy of being believed
to have ordered the fire. Hence, to suppress the rumor, he falsely
charged with the guilt and punished with the most exquisite tortures,
the persons commonly called Christians, who were hated for
their enormities.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Christus, the founder of that sect, was put to
death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the
reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a
time, broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief
originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all things
horrible and disgraceful flow from all quarters, as to a common receptacle,
and where they are encouraged.</p>

<p>Accordingly, first those were seized who confessed they were
Christians; next, on their information, a vast, multitude were convicted, not
so much on a charge of burning the city as of hating the
human race. And in their deaths they were also made the subjects
of sport, for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts and
worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and when
day declined burned to serve for nocturnal lights.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Nero offered his
own gardens for that spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately
mingling with the common people in the habit of a
charioteer, or else standing in his chariot. Whence a feeling of compassion
arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to
be made examples of by capital punishment, because they seemed
not to be cut off for the public good, but victims to the ferocity of
one man.”</p>
</div>


<p><b>Suetonius</b>, a contemporary of Tacitus, appears to have been
born in the reign of Vespasian. His literary labors began in
Trajan’s time; and under Hadrian he occupied the honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
position of private secretary, which, however, he lost in consequence
of disrespect to the empress.</p>

<p>The best-known of his works, and the only one that has
been preserved entire, is his “Lives of the Twelve Cæsars,”
full, interesting, and trustworthy in its information, clear and
vigorous in style. The “Cæsars” of Suetonius has always
been a standard. The Romans dwelt on his stories with
gusto; but in such frightful colors did he paint the deeds
of Caligula that the tyrant Com’modus made death by wild
beasts the penalty for reading his life of that emperor. After
the invention of printing, editions of Suetonius multiplied
rapidly.</p>


<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM SUETONIUS.</p>


<p class="center"><small>SUPERSTITION OF AUGUSTUS.</small></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some signs and omens he regarded as infallible. If in the morning
his shoe was put on wrong, the left instead of the right, that
boded some disaster. If when he commenced a long journey, by sea
or land, there happened to fall a mizzling rain, he held it to be a
good sign of a speedy and happy return. He was much affected likewise
with anything out of the common course of nature. A palm-tree
which chanced to grow up between some stones in the court of
his house, he transplanted into a court where the images of the household
gods were placed, and took all possible care to make it thrive.
He also observed certain days; as never to go from home the day
after the market-days, nor to begin any serious business upon the
nones.”</p>
</div>


<p><small>CHARACTER OF CALIGULA.</small></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Caligula evinced the savage barbarity of his temper by the following
indications. When flesh was only to be had at a high price
for feeding his wild beasts, he ordered that criminals should be
given them to be devoured. After disfiguring many persons of honorable
rank, by branding them in the face with hot irons, he condemned
them to the mines, to work in repairing the highways, or
to fight with wild beasts; or, tying them by the neck and heels,
would shut them up in cages, or saw them asunder.</p>

<p>Nor were these severities inflicted merely for crimes of great enormity,
but for making remarks on his public games, or for not having
sworn by the Genius of the emperor. He compelled parents to be
present at the execution of their sons; and to one who excused him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>self
on account of indisposition, he sent his own litter. He burned
alive the writer of a farce, for some witty verse which had a double
meaning. A Roman knight, who had been exposed to the wild
beasts, crying out that he was innocent, Caligula called him back,
and having had his tongue cut out, remanded him to the arena.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of his diversions, while gaming or feasting,
this savage ferocity never forsook him. Persons were often put to
the torture in his presence, while he was dining or carousing. At
Puteoli, at the dedication of the bridge, he invited a number of people
to come to him from the shore, and then suddenly threw them
headlong into the sea; thrusting down with poles and oars those
who, to save themselves, had got hold of the rudders of the ships.
As often as he met with handsome men, who had fine heads of hair,
he would order the back of their heads to be shaved, to make them
look ridiculous. At a sumptuous entertainment, he fell suddenly
into a violent fit of laughter, and upon the consuls’, who reclined
next to him, respectfully asking him the occasion, ‘Nothing,’ replied
he, ‘but that upon a single nod of mine, you might both have your
throats cut.’</p>

<p>In profuse expenditure he surpassed all the prodigals that ever
lived; inventing a new kind of bath, washing in precious unguents,
both warm and cold, drinking pearls of immense value dissolved in
vinegar, and serving up for his guests loaves and other victuals modelled
in gold. He built two ships with ten banks of oars, the sterns
of which blazed with jewels while the sails were of various colors.
They were fitted up with baths, galleries, and saloons, and supplied
with a great variety of vines and fruit-trees. In these he would sail
in the daytime along the coast of Campania, feasting amidst dancing
and concerts of music.”</p>

<p><small>STUPIDITY OF CLAUDIUS.</small></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among other things, people wondered at the indifference and
absent-mindedness of Claudius. Placing himself at table a little
after Messalina’s death, he inquired, ‘Why does not the empress
come?’ Many of those he had condemned to death, he ordered the
day after to be invited to his table, and to game with him, and sent
to reprimand them as sluggish fellows for not making greater haste.
The following expression he had in his mouth at all hours, ‘What!
do you take me for a fool?’</p>

<p>A man engaged in litigation before his tribunal drew Claudius
aside and told him, ‘I dreamt I saw you murdered;’ and shortly afterward,
when the defendant came to deliver his plea to the emperor,
the plaintiff, pretending to have discovered the murderer, pointed to
him as the man he had seen in his dream: whereupon, as if he had
been taken in the act, he was hurried away to execution.”—<span class="smcap">Dr.

<p><b>Pliny the Younger</b> (62-113 A.D.), nephew and adopted son
of the naturalist, learned his early lessons from Quintilian and
other celebrated rhetoricians. After figuring for a time as a
successful advocate, he was elevated to the consulship, and in
Trajan’s reign, having served his second term as consul, received
the appointment of governor of Bithynia.</p>

<p>Pliny took a prominent stand as the champion of the
wronged, and delighted in compelling dishonest governors to
disgorge their stolen spoils. The eloquent speeches identified
with his name have perished, with the exception of a single
specimen, a panegyric on Trajan. It is as a letter-writer that
Pliny is entitled to a place among the worthies of Latin literature.
His epistles to his friends and the emperor (in ten
books) are among the most pleasing relics of antiquity, affording,
as they do, many instructive glimpses of contemporary
society. They are written with life and polish, and show their
author to have been “the perfect type of a pagan gentleman.”</p>

<p>While governor of Bithynia, Pliny corresponded frequently
with Trajan on official business. We give below one of his
letters in relation to the Christians, with Trajan’s reply.</p>


<p class="center">PLINY’S LETTER ON THE CHRISTIANS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had never attended at the trial of a Christian; hence I knew
not what were the usual questions asked them, or what the punishments
inflicted. I doubted, also, whether to make a distinction of
ages, or to treat young and old alike; whether to allow time for recantation,
or to refuse all pardon whatever to one who had been a
Christian; whether, finally, to make the name penal, though no
crime should be proved, or to reserve the penalty for the combination
of both. Meanwhile, when any were reported to me as Christians,
I followed this plan. I asked them whether they were Christians.
If they said yes, I repeated the question twice, adding threats
of punishment; if they persisted, I ordered punishment to be inflicted.
For I felt sure that whatever it was they confessed, their inflexible
obstinacy well deserved to be chastised. There were ever,
some Roman citizens who showed this strange persistence; those I
determined to send to Rome.</p>

<p>As often happens in cases of interference, charges were now lodged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
more generally than before, and several forms of guilt came before
me. An anonymous letter was sent, containing the names of many
persons, who, however, denied that they were or had been Christians.
As they invoked the gods and worshipped with wine and
frankincense before your image, at the same time cursing Christ, I
released them the more readily, as those who are really Christians
cannot be got to do any of these things. Others, who were named
to me, admitted that they were Christians, but immediately afterward
denied it; some said they had been so three years ago, others
at still more distant dates, one or two as long ago as twenty years.
All these worshipped your image and those of the gods, and abjured
Christ. But they declared that all their guilt or error had amounted
to was this: they met on certain mornings before daybreak, and
sung one after another a hymn to Christ as God, at the same time
binding themselves by an oath not to commit any crime, but to abstain
from theft, robbery, adultery, perjury, or repudiation of trust.
After this was done, the meeting broke up; they, however, came together
again to eat their meal in common, being quite guiltless of
any improper conduct. But since my edict forbidding (as you ordered)
all secret societies, they had given this practice up.</p>

<p>However, I thought it necessary to apply the torture to some
young women who were called <i>ministræ</i> (deaconesses), in order, if
possible, to find out the truth. But I could elicit nothing from them
except evidence of some debased and immoderate superstition; so I
deferred the trial, and determined to ask your advice. For the matter
seemed important, especially since the number of those who run
into danger increases daily. All ages, all ranks, and both sexes, are
among the accused, and the taint of the superstition is not confined to
the towns; it has actually made its way into the villages. But I believe
it possible to check and repress it. At all events, it is certain
that temples which were lately almost empty are now well attended,
and sacred festivals long disused are being revived. Victims too are
flowing in, whereas a few years ago such things could hardly find a
purchaser. From this I infer that vast numbers might be reformed,
if an opportunity of recantation were allowed them.”</p>

<p>“I entirely approve of your conduct with regard to those Christians
of whom you had received information. We can never lay
down a universal rule, as if circumstances were always the same.
They are not to be searched for; but if they are reported and convicted,
they must be punished. But if any denies his Christianity
and proves his words by sacrificing to our divinity, even if his former
conduct may have laid him under suspicion, he must be allowed
the benefit of his recantation. No weight whatever should be attached
to anonymous communications; they are no Roman way of
dealing, and are altogether reprehensible.”—<span class="smcap">Cruttwell.</span></p>

<p>During the period under consideration, <span class="smcap">Florus</span> abridged
Livy’s “Annals;” <span class="smcap">Aulus Gellius</span> (125-175 A.D.) crowded
into his “Attic Nights” (a work in twenty books, prepared by
night at Athens) a vast store of historical anecdotes and extracts
from works now lost; <span class="smcap">Gaius</span>, the jurist, composed his
“Institutes;” and <span class="smcap">Fronto</span> wrote his epistles.</p>


<p><b>Apuleius.</b>—Last of the writers of this age, but by no means
least when we consider the influence of his tales upon modern
fiction, is Apuleius, author of the romance of “the Golden
Ass.” Lucius, the hero, an enthusiast in the study of magic,
having seen the sorceress Pam’phile transform herself into
an owl by rubbing an ointment on her person, endeavors,
with the help of her maid, to imitate her example. But
the girl selects the wrong box of ointment from her mistress’s
cabinet; and Lucius, on applying it, is changed into
a donkey.</p>

<p>Hardly, however, had the metamorphosis been effected when
a band of robbers made a descent upon the house, loaded
a portion of their plunder on the ass’s back, and made good
their escape, driving Lucius before them. In search of rose-leaves,
which the maid told him would remove the spell, the
hero meets with a series of marvellous adventures. Among
the episodes introduced is the oft-repeated tale of Cupid and
Psy’che. In the Decameron, Don Quixote, and Gil Bias, some
of these old Roman stories are told over again.</p>

<p>The style of Apuleius is unnatural; his Latin is bad.
Besides “the Golden Ass,” he wrote a discourse on Magic, on
“the God of Socrates,” and the “Florida,” a collection of
paragraphs from his own orations.</p>


<h4>LATER LATIN AUTHORS.</h4>

<p>After its temporary revival under Trajan’s kindly rule,
Latin literature gradually sunk into a hopeless decline. In
the long array of names that represent the last three cen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>turies
of the Roman Empire, we find none more worthy
of respect than those of the Latin fathers. Greatest of
these was</p>


<p><b>St. Augustine</b> (354-430 A.D.), of whom Tulloch said “no
single name has ever made such an impression upon Christian
thought.”</p>

<p>Impressed with the truth of the Gospel by the eloquence
of Ambrose at Milan, where he had gone to teach rhetoric,
Augustine at length received baptism, to the delight of his
saintly mother Mon’ica, who had long prayed for his conversion.
When raised to the bishopric of Hippo in Africa, Augustine
zealously engaged in a controversy with Pela’gius and
his followers, who entertained heterodox views in relation to
grace and original sin. The bishop put forth fifteen treatises
in refutation of the Pelagian heresies. His greatest works
were “the City of God,” a vindication of Christianity, “Confessions,”
and a treatise on the Trinity.</p>


<p><b>Ambrose</b>, bishop of Milan, who lived in the last half of the
fourth century, was the author of numerous epistles and
hymns, the <i>Te Deum</i> being one of his compositions. His
“Offices” defines the duties of Christian pastors.</p>


<p><b>St. Jerome</b> (Hieronymus) (340-420), the great apostle of
monasticism, from a convent at Bethlehem promulgated his
Latin version of the Old and New Testaments, called the
Vulgate (<i>common</i>) because designed for the use of the common
people, who understood no language but Latin. Jerome’s
Bible, adopted as a standard version, was the first book ever
put to press (1455).</p>


<p><b>St. Gregory</b>, bishop of Constantinople, the last of the four
great Latin fathers and the most poetical of early Christian
writers, has left us a book of epistles, orations, and religious
poems. He pressed into the service of Christianity the arts
of Greek rhetoric, and assailed Julian the Apostate in two
speeches that recall the invective of the Attic orators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span></p>


<p><b>Tertullian</b> (150-230), “the Master,” one of the earlier
Christian authors, is worthy of mention not only for his numerous
practical treatises on Penance, Idolatry, Theatrical
Exhibitions, etc., but also for his polemical works against
unbelievers, and the “Apologeticus” in defence of Christianity.
In after-life Tertullian joined a heretical sect.</p>

<p><b>Cyprian</b>, bishop of Carthage, the pupil of Tertullian, defended
his religion with an eloquent pen, and finally laid down his
life for his faith (258).</p>

<p><b>Lactantius</b>, “the Christian Cicero,” was the most learned
man of Constantine’s age (306-337). His earliest effort, an
hexameter poem, “the Banquet,” gained him such reputation
that the emperor Diocletian appointed him to give instruction
in rhetoric at Nicomedia. The “Banquet” is lost; but several
of the author’s prose works remain, the greatest being his
“Divine Institutions.” In his treatise “On the Death of the
Persecutors,” Lactantius endeavors to prove the avenging
hand of God in the violent ends of those emperors who had
oppressed his people.</p>

<p><b>Boëthius.</b>—Finally, we must notice the famous moral treatise
“On the Consolation of Philosophy,” by Boëthius, a Roman
noble who outlived the fall of his country (476). A
model of integrity and justice, Boëthius was loaded with
honors by Theod’oric, the Ostrogothic king of Italy; but
at last, falsely accused by his enemies of witchcraft and
treason, he was executed by his suspicious master (525).</p>

<p>The above-mentioned work was much read during the
Middle Ages. Alfred the Great rendered it into Anglo-Saxon;
Chaucer, into English; and later writers have reproduced its
sentiments.</p>


<h4>SPECIMENS OF LATER POETRY.</h4>

<p>As a favorable specimen of later Latin poetry, we quote a
few verses from an eclogue on hunting by <span class="smcap">Nemesian</span> (280),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> A thousand words have thus been traced through the sister languages of
Aryan birth—a number certainly adequate to the wants of primitive man, when
we remember that of more than 120,000 words which constitute our present vocabulary
but 3,000 are in common use. The Old Testament was translated with
the help of only 5,642 English words. While Shakespeare’s genius required
21,000 words for its expression, Milton’s epic employs less than half that number.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> In common with the Celts, the North American Indians, Chinese, Egyptians,
and other ancient nations, cherished a tradition that they had supplanted an original
population—<i>the children of the soil</i>—of low intellectual powers, feeders on
roots, hole-dwellers, serpent-eaters.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Some regard the Hindoo epics as belonging to a much later period. It is probable

life and strength: all the other gods seek for his blessing; death and immortality
are but his shadow.</p>

<p>The mountains covered with frost, the ocean with its waves, the vast regions
of heaven, proclaim his power.</p>

<p>By him the heaven and earth, space and the firmament, have been solidly
founded: he spread abroad the light in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Heaven and earth tremble for fear before him. He is God above all gods!”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> <i>Nirvâna</i>—“a condition of total cessation of changes; of perfect rest; of the
absence of desire, and illusion, and sorrow; of the total obliteration of everything
that goes to make up the physical man. Before reaching Nirvâna, man is constantly
being re-born; when he reaches Nirvâna, he is born no more.”—<i>Olcott’s
“Buddhist Catechism,” p. 32.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> We find one phase of this in the worship of ancestral tablets.
These are of wood, a foot high, and bear the name of the departed
ancestor, the hour of his birth, and that of his decease. They
are worshipped twice a month with tapers and burning incense.
Death is believed to liberate three spirits from the tenement of
clay; while one of these occupies the grave, and another seeks
the invisible world, the third is supposed to take up its habitation
in the tablet erected by filial reverence. The accompanying
engraving shows one of these ancestral tablets with its inscription
in Chinese. (<i>Read Du Bose’s “The Dragon, Image, and Demon.”</i>)</p>

of an earlier period; others believe it to have been reduced to its present
form at a much later date; while many theologians ascribe it all to Moses, except
the part that relates to his death and a few interpolated sentences. Its authenticity
as part of God’s Word has been disputed from time to time, and particularly
in these later days; but neither Jews nor Christians doubt its inspiration,
though they admit that in parts its meaning may have been misconceived.
We have here to do with it, as with other parts of the Bible, simply as a <i>literary</i>
work. (<i>See Rawlinson’s “Historical Illustrations of the Old Testament.”</i>)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> What is known as the Book of the Dead, or Funeral Ritual, is not a homogeneous
whole which has descended to us as such from antiquity, but a collection
of all the funeral texts found in various tombs. The dead man was believed to
encounter various dangers in the lower world, and hence it was of great importance
that he should be thoroughly instructed in advance. He had to know the
magical names of all parts of “the land of the dead,” of thousands of malignant
and benignant demons he would there meet. He must also be acquainted with
the names of the forty-two associate judges of Osiris who considered his claim
to admission into future joys, as well as with the proper confession to make to
each. The texts are partly descriptions of funeral ceremonies and of various
localities in the Lower Heaven, partly hymns and magical formulæ for exorcising
demons, and partly long speeches the dead man must pronounce, with
directions for making and inscribing amulets. Of these texts, some were written
on papyrus and placed in the tomb with the mummy, others were inscribed
on amulets and sarcophagi. In no one tomb have all been found.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> The Leucadian promontory projects from the southern shore of the island of
Leucadia, off the coast of Acarnania (see Map, p. 132). On the bluff stood a temple
of Apollo, to whom, in very ancient times, human sacrifices were yearly offered,
a victim being hurled from the rock into the sea below. The priests sometimes
took the place of these unfortunates, but on such occasions carefully avoided
danger by fastening to their persons flocks of live birds, the flapping of whose
pinions during the descent broke their fall. This rite was gradually modified;
and at one time we find the leap from the cliff used as an ordeal to test the guilt
of suspected persons.</p>

<p>In Sappho’s day it was customary for those suffering the pangs of unrequited
affection to take the Lover’s Leap from the precipice, after secretly uttering their
vows in the sanctuary of the god. Some, intent on suicide, were dashed to pieces
on the rocks below or perished in the waves; others took the precaution to buoy
themselves up with feathers or bladders, trusting to a plunge in the cold sea or
the bruises they might receive, to cure their passion. Queen Artemisia, of Halicarnassus,
lost her life in taking the Lover’s Leap, after putting out the eyes of
the youth who would not return her attachment; and one case is recorded in
which a man four times resorted to this perilous remedy.—The modern Greek
sailor still calls the promontory “the Lady’s Cape.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
